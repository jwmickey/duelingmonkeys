So the update itself will be short, or rather nevermind I'll tell a little story about today and make it longer. _Muhahaha...._

So my research professor lectured me again today about how I should leave my options open for the future. So that I may spend precious money and time to apply to grad schools, in the unlikely (or maybe likely who knows) event that if I don't get a good job I still have grad school as an option. But if I find the job of my dreams then I can still turn them down. Now this is good and all, and she actually did badger me enough until she convinced me, but the freakin' deadlines are in december. I have to now take GRE's, fill out applications, worry about teacher recs, and the lot. You know, all this, while trying to graduate, and find a part time job, is a pain in the butt.
 Anyway just thought I would inform the world that I am at the breaking point of my life where one simple decision either ruins it or seals the deal.

Anyway the boys were nagging me to put a receipe of a Hungarian dish I make often since its soooo incredibly simple (easier than Spaghetti). And so without further ado I present to you "Turos Teszta":http://www.duelingmonkeys.com/cooking.php?view=specific&item=32, literally meaning Cottage Cheese Pasta. Its good try it before you knock it.
