I saw X2 a while back, and I highly recommend it. I was a big fan of the first one to start with, but I think I enjoyed this one more. I think that the point of this post is to inform you that you should see that movie.

 Right, in other news, [here](https://content.duelingmonkeys.com/filespace/willow/mimesis/cast.jpg) is a nifty little sketch I did for this beach project, pretty, huh? Additionally, [here](https://content.duelingmonkeys.com/filespace/willow/mimesis/storyboards1.jpg) is another one.

 I know that's pretty lame as far as content goes, but if you feel like coming up with new, inventive crap every other day, please let [me](mailto:willow@duelingmonkeys.com) know, and I'll post it. Otherwise, stick a sock in it and go to [this rather interesting article](http://www.gamegirladvance.com/archives/2002/10/26/sex_in_games_rezvibrator.html). That should keep you baffled for a while.
