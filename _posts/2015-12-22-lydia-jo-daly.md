A bunch of cool stuff has happened in the past year but the big one that really eclipses the rest is that Amanda gave birth to a beautiful baby girl: I'm super excited to announce Lydia Jo Daly.

Here's some vital statistics:

* Birth date: 4/2/15, 2:41 PM
* Weight: 7 pounds 8 ounces
* Length: 18.5 inches

Lydia is an awesome baby, we are so lucky! She eats well, sleeps through the night, rarely cries or fusses, she's very healthy, she's developing well (she's crawling now and is great at grasping things).

You may have noticed that the birthday was a few months ago and the picture of that baby is not quite a newborn. The picture is also a few months old; she's grown even more! Being a dad has not made me any better at updating the webpage, rather it gives me an excuse for not updating as often.
