I can't (and don't really want to) figure out how to do frame capture without some sort of extra effort, therefore I won't. The whole thing was just to complain anyway, which I'm trying to keep to a minimum as it is. (I'm not very good at it)

 Anyway, I wrote a review of Capcom Vs. SNK 2: EO yesterday, I hope you enjoy it. I kind of start ranting towards the end, so it's a little longer than it needs to be, but hey, nobody complains (or compliments, or says anything at all)
