### Ingredients

* 1 package center cut bacon ($5)
* 2 10-pack large tortillas ($4)
* 1 pack sliced mushrooms ($2)
* 1 block mozzerela cheese ($2.50)
* 1 block montery jack cheese ($2.50)
* 1/2 block cheddar cheese ($1)
* 1 large onion (varies)
* 1 tbsp olive oil

### Directions

*Note:* This recipe is meant for 8-12 people, so get one of your slacker friends to help prepare this. First 3 steps can be done simultaneously

1. Saute sliced onion in olive oil on medium heat stirring occasionally. Once onions are slightly browned, add in the shrooms and mix well so the olive oil coats them. Turn heat to low.
1. Grate the cheese
1. Fry or broil bacon until slightly crispy and a good amount of that nasty grease drains out
1. Construction of these monsters works best on an assembly line. One person should put a layer of mushrooms and onions, another to add a strip of bacon and a handful of cheese, and one more person to finish them up on a dry frying pan or a George Foreman grill
1. Grill or fry the quesadillas in a dry frying pan until cheese is melted

### Comments

You won't find these in a Healthy Choice package, but thats what makes them sooo good.

 This recipe serves a ton of people, so if you're not up for entertaining any guests this time, scale down the proportions according to our [regular quesadillas](/recipes/quesadillas.html).

 The numbers (with the exception of quality) for this meal seem like its too much trouble, but thats mostly because of the biohazardous bacon grease; accounting for the horrible rating in both health and cleanup.

 As you might can see, these take a considerable amount of time to prepare, but we are sure that you and your guests will be more than satisfied with your finished product, so throw a fiesta!

 Also, if everyone chips in a little this meal turns out to beat the pants off of even Taco Bell prices.
