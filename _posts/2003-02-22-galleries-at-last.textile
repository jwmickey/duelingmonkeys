After much time and toil, we have finally programmed the "galleries":coolstuff.php?view=images&section=art to be beautiful, dynamic, wonderful things. Thanks to the brilliant way in which they were designed, it is pretty easy to make new gallerys, so expect me to post lots of crap like pictures of my feet when I am bored.

 Other than that, I redrew our character icons on the "about us":aboutus.php page, but they turned out crappier than the ones before. The most notable addition here is the presence of a new site contributor. Everybody give a big welcome to Wesley Monkey. You can read all about him at "about us":aboutus.php, except that I wrote all that stuff and not him, so it doesn't make any sense. Sorry. I'll be hard at work trying to get him to write an article for us.
