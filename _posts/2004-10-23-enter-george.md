Hi everyone!

 Man, it's been so long. We have a lot to catch up on. As many of you may know, I recently shaved the old goatee. Believe it or not, it was in an attempt to look more like Wayne. Now that the deed is done, I wonder what the hell I was thinking? Oh well, nothing I can do about it now. You can decide whether you like it better or not by following these easy-to-compare before/after pictures.

 [After!](https://content.duelingmonkeys.com/gallery/willow/withoutgoatee.jpg) (happy)

 The question now is, what would I look like with a goatee AND smiling. Well, it's too late to take a picture of that, so we'll have to rely on some DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY!

 [Maybe?](https://content.duelingmonkeys.com/gallery/willow/withgoatee2.jpg) Maybe not.

 Pretty cool, huh? I've made another drastic change that many of you do not know about, however. Just today, I drove out and picked up George who is the latest addition to the monkey household. I'm pretty excited about having George live with us. Perhaps I can concoct an excuse to invite a bunch of people over so you can all meet him.

 Also, I've been doing a ton of cool things at work. One of which is learning about radiosity in 3D Studio Max. Because of this, I've recently become obsessed with rendering things using radiosity. I love it. I hope to get some of my old models a new radiosity rendering sometime soon so you can see how cool it is.

 If I didn't have to go watch a Star Wars documentary now, I'd probably write a rant about car repair shops and how much they are liars. But I do have to go watch the documentary, so you'll just have to take my word for it.

 Peace.
