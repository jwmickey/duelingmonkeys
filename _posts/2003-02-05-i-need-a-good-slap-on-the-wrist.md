I seem to recall posting that I was actually going to try to do some work that was postable a couple days ago. Let it finally be known then that this ... was a blatant lie.

 However, I haven't spent all this time totally idle. I've been working on a map for this cool AI presentation in Australia in the UT 2K3 engine. My job is to make a good looking city bank thing. Well, it's not looking too good, but a little (/lot) more believable than the map they've currently got. Anyway, so any of youse don't feel abandonned, I will post up some screenshots fors ya. Here yas go:

 [Bank 2](http://www.duelingmonkeys.com/classic/filespace/willow/mimesis/bank1.jpg)
 [Bank 3](http://www.duelingmonkeys.com/classic/filespace/willow/mimesis/bank2.jpg)
 [Bank 4](http://www.duelingmonkeys.com/classic/filespace/willow/mimesis/bank3.jpg)
 [Bank 5](http://www.duelingmonkeys.com/classic/filespace/willow/mimesis/bank4.jpg)

 Well, now you have some pixels to look at before you move on with your usual web-&quot;surfing&quot; routine (I hate the word &quot;surfing&quot;, it sounds so corny by now), which should include no less than [Penny Arcade](http://www.penny-arcade.com), [IGN](http://xbox.ign.com), [8-bit theater](http://www.nuklearpower.com), [some random messageboard](http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs), and of course [some totally useless site](http://www.duelingmonkeys.com). by the way, I post as WillowMonkey on the aforementioned messageboard, although I'm sure none of you give a &#42;poop&#42;.

 Below are links for the master only, so that I don't have to type in the whole damn webaddress to download them. If you follow the link, you will be following it to your death.

 PS - Jamstudio graphics tablet sucks.

 Peace out. Death to Final Fantasy.
