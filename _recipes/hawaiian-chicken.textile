### Ingredients

* 4 boneless skinless chicken breasts
* 1 can sliced pineapple
* 4 tablespoons sweet n' sour sauce (can use barbeque sauce as substitute

### Directions

# Mix sauce with some of the juice from the pineapple until you get a thinner sauce that can be brushed on to the chicken as its cooking
# Fire up the charcoal
# Start cooking the chicken
# Brush on some sauce each time you flip the chicken (about once every few minutes)
# During the last 2 minutes or so of cooking, grill the pineapple until its lightly browned from the grill.
# Be sure the chicken is white all the way through! Duh!!

### Comments

Pretty good stuff. Another way to serve up chicken thats a lot more healthy than frying it.
