It's nearly 2 AM, and I'm a bad student. I have a mid-term tommorow, which I feel pretty confident about, but I have class in 6 hours and am obviously not asleep yet.

 I had a big weekend though, so it's ok. I went down to Oak Island to do a little chillin and a little fishing. Mostly chillin. I ate more than any one person should at Golden Corral. I felt bad the rest of the night and the next morning. I got some homework done and managed to do some laundry (yes, both of these things at the beach). I don't usually do any homework until Sunday night, but I was in the mood for once.

 In other news, NC State finally beat Maryland for the first time in 4 years, and it was almost a shut-out on the road too! Yay for us! I had a very spaced-out drive back to Raleigh today, which inspired [this rant](http://www.duelingmonkeys.com/otc.html?view=specific&item=51) about the upcoming election. I hope you enjoy it but if you don't, please don't tell me. I stayed up an extra hour writing it (thanks to GW's website) and would be heartbroken if you didn't agree with me.

 Okay, not really. Go ahead and [complain](mailto:wayne@duelingmonkeys.com).
