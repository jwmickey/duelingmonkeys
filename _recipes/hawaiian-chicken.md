### Ingredients

* 4 boneless skinless chicken breasts
* 1 can sliced pineapple
* 4 tablespoons sweet n' sour sauce (can use barbeque sauce as substitute

### Directions

1. Mix sauce with some of the juice from the pineapple until you get a thinner sauce that can be brushed on to the chicken as its cooking
1. Fire up the charcoal
1. Start cooking the chicken
1. Brush on some sauce each time you flip the chicken (about once every few minutes)
1. During the last 2 minutes or so of cooking, grill the pineapple until its lightly browned from the grill.
1. Be sure the chicken is white all the way through! Duh!!

### Comments

Pretty good stuff. Another way to serve up chicken thats a lot more healthy than frying it.
