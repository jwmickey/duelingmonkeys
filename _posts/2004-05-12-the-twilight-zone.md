It feels so weird. I'm out in the mountains now. I'm not even really sure how I got here. I slept for 13 hours last night. What day is it? Weird.

 I'm supposed to graduate in a few days I guess. I don't think I have to do any more schoolwork until then. I'm almost out of college. What will I do with myself?

 Well, I would have like to have gone out with a bang, but it seems this breif, meaningless post is the last you will hear from Willow: Disaffected college student. Fortunately, I already have a replacement lined up; Willow: unemployed bum.

 I would like to post up some pics, but as I said, I'm in the mountains far away from all that. Oh well.

 As far as college goes, I think I had a pretty good run.

 _I'll catch you on the flip-side._
