After many sessions of whining from Willow, I finally made the time to fix the gallery page. You may remember that a while back I introduced Dueling Monkeys Galleries 2.0, a custom built gallery based on XML that I wrote in an effort to better familarize myself with XML and it's various applications. Geek talk aside, I just didn't finish it. I really hate doing that, but I'm awful good at it (gallery, movie exchange, im client, message board upgrades, etc.).

 So, for the galleries, I decided to go with the very popular yet horribly unoriginally named [Gallery](http://gallery.sourceforge.net) (version 2). It works great, and allows for captions, comments, easy management, searching, and a whole lot more features. I spent today trimming out most of those cool features, but we may or may not add some in on a per request basis. I did a fairly quick yet very ugly hack on the default theme to make it fit our Dueling Monkeys theme.

 Those that use [Firefox](http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox) should be good to go, but unfortunately people who are forced (or for some reason still use) Internet Explorer, things aren't going to be perfect. Because of the nature of our site design, we have a limited viewing area for images. Most of the photos we have will fit in our window, but Internet Explorer decides to put scrollbars around the photos if they are even slightly too big to fit, even if they appear otherwise. It beats the alternative, trust me. Just click that previous link and save yourself. I don't have access to a Mac, so if it looks absolutely horrible in Safari, please [let me know](mailto:wayne@duelingmonkeys.com) and I'm sorry.

 Bare with us as we migrate our images to the new gallery, as well as clean up some things that just don't belong on the site.
