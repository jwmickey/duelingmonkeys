Hi guys. It's friday and, as usual, nobody has anything worth updating, so I'm here to post a picture, and some random useless link good for nothing but killing time. But that is why you came here in the first place, right? I thought so too.

 So Wayne and I were looking through this little computer catalog to see what they had on sale. In their little catalog, Dell showed a diagram of all the states that had Dell stores at malls. Take a look at it, and pay close attention to the states that matter. [Dell's view of the US](https://content.duelingmonkeys.com/gallery/humor/godell.jpg).

 It's nice to know that a big company like Dell is not so rigid that it gets bogged down by minor details like, say, the location of states.

 For my random link today, check out [The Art of Hyung Taekim](http://hyung-taekim.org/). That guy is freakin awesome.
