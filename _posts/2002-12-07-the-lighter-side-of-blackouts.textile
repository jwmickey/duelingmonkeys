The past few days many denizens of Raleigh were without power due to the ice storm. Wayne and I were not, so we took in some poor cold friends for a while so they wouldn't freeze to death. What followed was a series of cooking frenzies.

 First we made "Super Quesadillias":cooking.php?view=specific&item=2, accompanied by "Five cup salad":cooking.php?view=specific&item=11 which was very pleasing to us all. Some people wouldn't even try the five cup salad simply because it has sour cream. I wanted to kick many people in the pants. Then our guest cook Naveen whipped us up some "Chili":cooking.php?view=specific&item=10, and Wayne introduced to his disturbingly-hot "Clam Chowder":cooking.php?view=specific&item=9. All in all, our kitchen was left a nuclear wasteland where many wars appear to have been fought. But our struggle has earned you many new recipes that simply must be tried.
