Hey guys, sorry the long time with no updates. Looks like we missed two strait months. Oops. Well, let the excuses begin.

 First of all, around the end of April and beginning of May, [Emergent](http://www.emergent.net) (the company I work for) released Gamebryo 2.3! Gamebryo kicks ass and you should all be excited about frame rendering and generalized dynamic shadow mapping (even if you don't know what those are). That's my main excuse for April - things always get pretty busy leading up to releases and this was no exception.

 Unfortunately, the relaxing period that comes right after a release seems to be a tradition they decided to do away with this time around. Pretty much right away I've got my nose right back on the grindstone. Now that I think of it, I'm actually working more hours now than I was leading up to the release.

 Also during this time I got a raise, a bonus, and a pretty significant tax return right at the same time. I decided to take advantage of my newfound treasure and do something that I've been needing to do for a long long time; move to Durham. I've managed to acquire a new house over there so I should be moving by the end of this month. This should knock about 25-30 minutes off of my commute - each way. In case you are curious where exactly I'll be, if everything goes to plan I'll be at [4806 Tapestry Terrace](http://www.google.com/maps?daddr=4806+Tapestry+Terrace&saddr=2000+deep+forest+trail+raleigh&f=d&sll=35.965503,-78.882866&sspn=0.108371,0.233459&ie=UTF8&z=11&om=1).

 Between those things, I haven't had a whole lot of extra time to do much else. Except for play video games, of course. I've recently played through Metroid Fusion, Castlevania: Circle of the Moon, Mega Man Zero 2, Advance Wars, Advance Wars 2, Lost Planet, [Cave Story](http://www.miraigamer.net/cavestory/) (free, awesome; try it if you own a PC gamepad), and Aegis Wing. I'm currently working on Ikaruga and Golden Sun.

 As far as video games go, I've barely gotten anything done on Navi. The only improvements I've made since last update are that the physics are now inexplicably busted and I added a better [sun](https://content.duelingmonkeys.com/gallery/game%20dev/sun1.jpg). It's not too much to look at unless it's animated.

 Wayne and I also recently took a vacation in Hawaii. It was nice, but Wayne took all of the pictures and now he's hoarding them all for himself, so I have nothing to post from that.

 Well, that's about all I have to say. Don't forget to play Cave Story.
