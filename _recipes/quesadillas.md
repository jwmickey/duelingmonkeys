### Ingredients

* 10 pack large tortillas ($2)
* 1/2 pack sliced mushrooms ($1)
* 1/2 block mozzerela cheese ($1)
* 1/2 block montery jack cheese ($1)
* 1 onion (varies)
* 1 tbsp olive oil

### Directions

1. Saute sliced onion in olive oil on medium heat stirring occasionally.
1. Grate the cheese while the onions are browning
1. Once onions are slightly browned, add in the shrooms and mix well so the olive oil coats them. Turn heat to low.
1. Fill your tortillas with a thin layer of mushrooms and onions and a handful of cheese, then fold in half.
1. Grill or fry the quesadillas in a dry frying pan until cheese is melted

### Comments

We personally reccomend using a George Foreman Grill to melt the cheese. Its quick, easy, and requires less cleanup. This recipe makes enough for 3 to 5 people, unless you think you can hang with Wayne and Willow and finish all 10 in one sitting.
