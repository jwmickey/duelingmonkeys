All my life I have been searching for a wild animal that can execute the coveted screw attack. I had almost given up hope until today (err, actually a few days ago), my search came to an abrupt end.

 Indeed, Deep in the bamboo forests of somewhere, a panda lives capable of annihilating lanterns with the most devastating of attacks. In case you are wondering what I'm talking about, I have a convenient little link to it. "Behold, the mighty screw attack!":http://www.orisinal.ws/games/panda3.htm

 In other news, I will be out of town this weekend, don't be expectin nothin from Wayne in the way of updates (I just said that to enrage him into doing one just to prove me wrong). Ciao
