It's not too often nowadays I do art just for art's sake. But today, I did just that. I'm getting a little faster I think. This one only took me a couple hours from concept to completion.

 In case anyone is wondering what I look like in real life, I can assure you I look exactly like "this":images/gallery/art/actionwillow.jpg. Yeah, I'm cool.

 Behind the iron curtain, the industrial strength web-machine I like to call 'Wayne' has been slaving away at some code, and it sould only be a matter of months before the galleries are finally up and running.

 A digital camcorder has been secured for the filming of &quot;the Crash&quot; (tenative title).

 And one last thing, I finally cancelled my cell phone subscription this morning. I hate that thing.
