It's time to celebrate! Today, our website passed the milestone of 100,000 hits! Woo-hoo! we are the bombX0R.

 However, I'd like to take this celebration post to explain a well-kept internet secret. The administrators of most websites definately don't want you (or the people that advertise there) to know this. HITS ARE ABSOLUTELY MEANINGLESS. Have 100,000 people gone to our site? no. Does anyone go to our site? no. Wayne and I probably caused all of those hits ourselves. Have we gone to the site 100,000 times? Hell no. Each time someone visits here, it might cause up to 100 hits just because each hit is a request for a bit of information. That means the dynamic database and all our pretty pictures and stuff give us a rediculus amout of hits. Now that the galleries are up, that will probably increase even more. So just so you know, when people say how many hits they get, the are full of it, nobody visits their crappy page.

 Keep that a secret though, because advertisers might not know that, and it'd be pretty sweet to tell some dolt that they need to pay us a ton to put up an ad when we have 100,000 hits. Plus, it's a big number and fuels my deflated ego.
