# The Orbs

One Christmas Willow got a Wacam drawing tablet and was itching to put it to use, and thus the 
orb design was born.  The squigily lines made for a very unique layout but was tricky to use 
for a webpage with varying widths and heights.  This was of course long before modern CSS features 
like Flexbox or CSS Grid, so the HTML to get this working was an ugly mess of tables and you 
know it used a healthy dose of `MM_preloadImages` for the image swap on rollover!

I couldn't find that code anywhere, but the images survived and with the help of this awesome 
[CSS Grid Generator](https://cssgrid-generator.netlify.app/) by [Sarah Drasner](https://twitter.com/sarah_edo), I was able to quicly ressurect the design.

We even had a few seasonal/holiday themes for [Fall](/about/orbs-fall.html),
[Halloween](/about/orbs-halloween.html), and [Christmas](/about/orbs-christmas.html)!

Unfortunately this design has some flaws like actually being able to know what the links were for 
without hovering, or even to be able to read the font when you did hover, but man it was pretty cool 
for a useless blog-ish site of the early 2000's!  None of the links actually work, but you can hover over them to see the effect.
