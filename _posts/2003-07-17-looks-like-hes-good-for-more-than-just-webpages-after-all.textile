Howdy folks. This friday, I have a nice treat for you. Wayne has put us together a nice little movie for you to watch. It depicts the proper procedure for a surgical operation on a watermellon. May I present:

 "Like a Surgeon":movies/watermelon.wmv

 I hope you are as entertained as we were while making it. While Wayne was busy editing that little film, I was busy at work as well. As I have mentioned I have a job doing some game art, and I have managed to come up with a couple new tidbits i can post.

 First off, I'm going to show a couple of the level, which is finally making it's way to presentable mode: "shot 1":imageviewer.php?image=images/gallery/modeling/ingame3.jpg, "shot 2":imageviewer.php?image=images/gallery/modeling/ingame4.jpg, "shot 3":imageviewer.php?image=images/gallery/modeling/ingame5.jpg, and "shot 4":imageviewer.php?image=images/gallery/modeling/ingame6.jpg. Also, as you may have noticed in one of the above, I created a custom character model for the game. You can see him in action in one of the normal UT levels "here":imageviewer.php?image=images/gallery/modeling/ingame1.jpg, and "here":imageviewer.php?image=images/gallery/modeling/ingame2.jpg.

 Well, I guess that'll be all for now. Come back monday because I'm sure I will not have anything to write about and will post a funny link instead.
