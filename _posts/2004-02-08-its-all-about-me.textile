well, i've been rather slack as far as making updates, but i've finally gotten around to writing one again. and what delicious uselessness do i have for you today you might ask, my little kumquats? today i have finally added some pictures (not the moving sort though) to "Wesley's Gallery":galleries.php?section=Wesley!! YAY! ok, so maybe its not that exciting. so if that's not enough, i have also updated "my profile":/about/index.html#wesley finally. i also have some funny little videos i'd like to put up, but won't right now so's you'll have some motavation to come back... actually, i am not sure how to do it, and i have to wait for wayne to show me. so! thats it for today! have a great ... long time until i post again.
