Hello friends. It appears that I didn't update during the month of May. Sorry about that. You are probably going to be even more disappointed by this update, which won't have any pictures and will be relatively brief.

Here's a quick list of interesting things that I've done since my last update

* Drove and walked around on the Blue Ridge Parkway in the NC mountains
* Gone caving in West Virginia
* Been crunching to finish [Orcs Must Die!](http://www.orcsmustdie.com) at work
* A bunch of other stuff that I've probably already forgotten

And just for fun, here's a list of games I've been playing recently (as well as their corresponding Wikipedia pages for your convenience):

* [Yoshi's Island](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoshi%27s_island)
* [Vanquish](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanquish_%28video_game%29)
* [Age of Wonders](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_wonders)
* [Desktop Dungeons](http://www.desktopdungeons.net/) (ok, that's not a Wikipedia page, but tragically it doesn't seem to have one yet

Sorry for the lame update. See you later
