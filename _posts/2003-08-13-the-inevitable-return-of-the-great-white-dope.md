I am Wesley Monkey, and this is my first post (_applause_). I am also a student at NCSU along with Willow and Wayne (_applause_) and WE LIVE TOGETHER (_a lone cricket chirps_). I have finally returned from my world travels (_quiet reverence_) and will be sharing my worldly wisdom (read: useless drivel) with you weeknights at 10!!! (_wild applause_). not only that my little monkey fans, but i can cook too! (_silent awe, followed by ecstatic applause and cheers_).

 as i have only just returned, i have not been formally added to the site yet, and anything you read about me is misinformed misinformation. as soon as i get around to it, my information will be updated and i will officially be part of the site. thank you for you attention, you may now return to your regular programming. (_frenzied applause and cheers on the scale of which has never been experienced by any in the world. pants are wetted, hair is rent, there is much swooning_).
