### Miscellaneous Old Stuff

In our college days we had small projects here and here.  Sometimes they were decent ideas with good intentions,
but never fulfilled, such as the movie exchange project (I'm sorry Colin!).  Sometimes they were ideas created in the
wee hours of the morning after many beers, such as the movie poster maker.  On rare occasions they were actually
good ideas that are still useful today (if you are a cheap college student), like the cooking section.

p. We've really trimmed the site down since then, so for these things that still work but don't have a home in the
 main navigation, here they are.

  * [Cooking](/cooking/index.html) - yes, we ate this stuff.
  * [Movie Maker](/moviemaker/) - an action movie poster generator, with not near enough unique graphics

Yep, two whole things.
