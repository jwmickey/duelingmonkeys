ok, so here we have another update, yay! go check your pants. todays update will be pretty useless, but hey, aren't they all? anyway, on to the content!!! Dahn duhn duhhhhhh... we have two links for yous. just a bit of randomness to waste your time. today we have some sexy stuff, so if you don't like sexy stuff, STAY AWAY! [Wizard rubs britany spears carrots with his zucchinis](http://www.pointsincase.com/aim_convos/cybersex_comedy.htm). did i say sexy? i meant WIERD. and also HELLARIOUS. one reader said this was &quot;spontainiously, explosively funny&quot;... and then he died. this is not for the faint of heart.

we have one bonus link for you today, just in case that wasn't enough, and your still alive. this one is entitled[WTF](http://home.tiscali.nl/multicom/DaSchop/endofworld.swf). have a nice day (if you aren't dead).
