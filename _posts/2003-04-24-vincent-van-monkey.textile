I spent this afternoon gathering a lot of my modeling and level design stuff into one place. After getting it in the appropriate format, i went ahead and added it to the galleries. So, you will now find a much expanded "modeling gallery":http://www.duelingmonkeys.com/galleries.php?section=modeling. This represents a fair deal of the work I've done for mimesis these past two semesters as well as some of the game design stuff I've done before that.

 Additionally, I've been working on another movie project, which I've tenatively called &quot;Ios Trailer&quot;. I've put together a screenshot of one of the scenes in the art gallery "here":http://www.duelingmonkeys.com/imageviewer.php?image=images/gallery/art/foreboding.jpg. Let that be a little preview for you. In the end, the trailer should be a little less than a minute long, feature a mixture of 3d and 2d art, and should have an original soundtrack. Look for it in the distant future.
