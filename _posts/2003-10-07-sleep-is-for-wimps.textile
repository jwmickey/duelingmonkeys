I have began a new day with no sleep. Even after a hard night's work when I thought I was going to pass out from exaustion (I'm sure I spelled that wrong). But alas, here I am, English paper in hand (err, to be printed soon) waiting for the oven to preheat so I can enjoy some Flaky Layers Grands Biscuits along with scrambled eggs. It's almost worth staying up for.

 I'm sure I'll disagree with that last statement in about 2 hours. Since I've been busy with this paper, the only update I have for today is my story of staying up all night and of course, the movie exchange. If you haven't heard about it, visit the message board and take a look. Currently there are 138 movies in the database and the potential for hundreds more if you guys participate. "Email me":mailto:wayne@duelingmonkeys.com if you want to sign up and I'll create an account for you.

 Have a great hump day! I'll be passing out in approx. 6 hours until it's time to go to work.
