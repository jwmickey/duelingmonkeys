Not much for today, but we do have a short video of some of Willow's mad skillz. "The hand":filespace/willow/hand.avi was modeled and animated in 3D Studio Max. It's for holding a &quot;weapon&quot; in the sunburn project we've been mentioning over the past couple of weeks.

 Willow speaking now, Wayne doesn't really know what to say, and saying as he helped me out with my updates, I'm takin' over this one.

 So yes, that is my hand model, and I'm getting paid to make that for 'academic' purposes. Isn't my job great? In fact, although not as humorous as the other, I think I'll make a movie of my other recent model for project sunburn.

 Making movie ...

 Done! That was easy. Athough probably less interesting, this is the "Sand Crab":filespace/willow/crab.avi I made for the same job. In case you were curious, those were both compressed with the divx codec. This lets them bee itty-bitty little files, which is good for us. If you don't have the divx codec, you can download it from "www.divx.com":http://www.divx.com

 Well, I think that satisfies the content requirement for a post even for the likes of Wayne, so I'm going to hit it. Peace out, see you friday.

 By the way, something really cool happens 2 weeks from today. BE READY!
