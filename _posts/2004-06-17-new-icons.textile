Hey everyone. I have toiled the past few days making up new icons for our beloved duelingmonkeys characters. However, I am in the mountains right now, forbidding me from doing the final touches to make them viewable as news and messageboard icons. Wayne will apparently have to do a little extra work to get the png format to show up correctly as well.

 In the meantime, I've placed them all in the "art gallery":http://www.duelingmonkeys.com/galleries.php?section=art&type=image. For your convenience, I'll go ahead and post direct links too:

 "Wayne":javascript:showPic('images/gallery/art/wayneicons.jpg','475','475')

 "Yours Truly":javascript:showPic('images/gallery/art/willowicons.jpg','475','475')
