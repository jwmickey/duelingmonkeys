Man, you wouldn't believe how busy I've been recently! I haven't been able to slow down all week, and that's after taking a few days off work. I've been constantly darting between events this past week, which, when combined with Wayne's disinterest in posting stuff means no updates have been here for a while.

 I plan to remedy that, [with this](/classic/images/gallery/art/fireball.jpg) a little character I made for the game developer's club. I hope to make 3 more interesting ones and post them all.

 Don't count on it coming soon though, the whirlwind is still on the horizon, I never know when I'll be swept away for a few days. If any of this sounds really stupid, it's because I didn't get any sleep last night.

 I figure I should give a link for some bored person to follow. Let me think ... yes, I have it. Today's selection is something so pathetic, that it leads one to wonder if it's just some sort of sick joke. Anyway, enjoy: ['OUR MISSION STATEMENT: To track, synthesize and expose the secret, social and political corruption of America's powerful, government financed Lesbian Mafia.](http://www.lesbianstudies.com/index.htm)

 It's madness, I know. Hey, if you guys have some interesting links, why don't you post a few of them in the [messageboards](topics.php?)
