Hey guys. I created another short crappy game recently that I figured I'd post about. The game is called &quot;Mash Buttons Until Death&quot; or MaBUD for short. You can check out the "Games page":/games/mash-buttons-until-death.html for it if you are interested in getting more information on the game and why it is so crappy.

There is exciting stuff going on in "Karma Riot":/games/karma-riot-v1.html as well, but I'll save that for another post. For now I'll just tease with this screenshot:
