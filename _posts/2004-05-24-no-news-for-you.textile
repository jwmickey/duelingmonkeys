So it turns out our server deleted a month's worth of news posts. This is kind of frustrating considering that I'd written some expansive updates since I graduated. We are trying to recover them. I'm dissapointed in this, so I'm not going to write another update until I either get them back or know for sure that they are gone forever.

 That is all.
