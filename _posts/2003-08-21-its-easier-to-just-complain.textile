Everyone around here sure whines a lot about how crappy my updates are, but it's friday morning, and I don't see anyone else stepping up to bat, so you people will have to deal with it.

 So, uh in case you didn't get it, my last post was a set of haiku talking about the return of school, among other things. I used to think I loved going to college. As it turns out I do love going to college, just not going to class.

 I'm actually pretty grumpy about the 23 books I have to buy this semester, so instead of posting a big whine about it which will cause me to be inevitably griped at by Wayne, I will just end it with this (which will inevitably get me griped at by Wayne).
