I have a lot of things that I like to do with what few shreds of free time I have. Occasionally I like to draw stuff on the computer. A couple of days back, I decided to start a new drawing with the intention of posting it here. Things went downhill from there. I'm going to take this news post to relate to you how a good idea for a drawing evolves into a bad drawing in a few easy to swallow steps.

 [Step 1: The thumbnail](images/gallery/willow/art/layer1.jpg) - a quick sketch of the idea gave me the impression I was off to a good start.

 [Step 2: The rough sketch](images/gallery/willow/art/layer2.jpg) - for some reason, going over the thumbnail with some rough lines didn't turn out nearly as well as I thought it would. I would almost be willing to say the thumbnail was better.

 [Step 3: The lines](images/gallery/willow/art/layer3.jpg) - after I get done inking the lines in, the rough sketch suddenly looks good. Looks good in a bad way because it only looks good because the lines look bad.

 [Step 4: The flats](images/gallery/willow/art/layer4.jpg) - just after adding the basic colors was definately the all time low for this picture. For some reason, it just doesn't look good.

 [Step 5: The light at the end of the tunnel](images/gallery/willow/art/layer5.jpg) - I added the shadowing as a seperate layer, and by itself, it actually doesn't look that bad. Let's just hope that when we combine it with the colors we get a pleasing result.

 [Step 6: DENIED](images/gallery/willow/art/layer6.jpg) - Nope, doesn't look better. New all time low for this picture.

 [Step 7: Cut losses, learn lesson](images/gallery/willow/art/layer7.jpg) - In one last final ditch effort I added some highlites, but to little avail. At this point, I surrender. This image cannot be salvaged. It sucks.

 *Step 8: Post findings on internet* - The experience of trying to create this failed drawing did not teach me anything new or interesting. Therefore I figured it belonged where the rest of the worlds useless and uninteresting junk is kept.

 I congratulate you if you've actually made it this far through my post. I will reward you with a little bit of irony. I spent probably 5 or 6 hours of my precious free time to make that crappy picture I've been yapping about this whole time and it looks like crap. [This](images/gallery/willow/modeling/easterheads.jpg), however took me about an hour, I did it while I was at work, and in my humble opinion, it looks about ten times better. Isn't that funny?
