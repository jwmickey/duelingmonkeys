So while bored at work... uhhh I mean constantly working hard at my demanding job... I decided to do some gmax tutorials. Our fiscal year ended on march 1st so for the month of march I had a lot of down time. I realize we are in may now, but come on I do do some work, and I'm not going to post tutorial created work as my content.

 In short and getting back to the point... I decided to experiment with lip-syncing in 3ds max. I used the model head I created from gmax for doing this, and unfortunately the mesh did not export and reimport so well and I have no desire to spend lots and lots of time to go back and reedit a head I shall never work with again _(at least anytime soon)_. So if the mouth doesn't look quite right... well tough it, this was just experimenting, and I figured some content is better than no content. Also the compression is super high so I've noticed that the playback will skip (i.e. the mouth freezes up at times). In the meantime I have also created some other model heads and when I finish with them you will see some more fabulous content filled updates!

 So here is your [do not forget to read your webcomics link](http://www.squidi.net) and of course [your link to content!](http://www.duelingmonkeys.com/classic/filespace/wastrel/mixmaster.avi)
