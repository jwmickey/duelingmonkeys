So I've started on a new hobby project. I'm not far enough along to go into details, but I have come up with one bit of technology that I think is cool so I'll talk about it now.

A lot of levels in games are rectangular (from above) - being a rectangle makes a lot of things easier. Rectangles correspond to the shape of textures and regular geometric grids that can be used for terrain height fields. It's easy to make a rectangular world wrap too by just making sure it is tileable and drawing a few extra copies of the world once you get within sight of borders. A rectangle lets you use euclidean coordinate space. If I wanted to create a world, it would be easy to draw a rectangular map.

However, it would be cool if the world was really stylized, like you are walking/flying over the surface of a mini planet. You can percieve the curvature of the world - it falls off in your peripheral vision and things climb up over the horizon as you move. Well, if your map needs to be spherical, it suddenly becomes a lot harder to draw. You have to start using spherical coordinates too, which complicates things like finding distances or even moving at a consistent speed in any direction.

The thing I came up with is a way to use a wrapping rectangular world, but give it the illusion that it is spherical - a spherical rectangle. It's not rocket science or anything, but I think it's a neat concept and can be kind of a brain teaser to figure out how everything can continue to line up as you move over its surface.

Finally, I put together some animated gifs of the world spinning in a few directions; can you tell that the rectangular world is repeating in every direction? The world still retains its rectangular proportions despite how much you spin the sphere - mysterious!
