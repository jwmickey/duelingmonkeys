If it wasn't for a few social activities with special people this week, I could easily list it as one of the worst in my entire college career.

 Even by today (Friday), I've barely challenged the stuff I have to get done by the end of school (next Tuesday). I'm working as hard as I can, and still always seem to be falling farther behind. I've been missing nights of sleep. I came down with a miserable sickness which won't go away because I can't sleep it off. I've had a lot of trauma with my senior project which would not be worth going into the details on. I'm dissapointed in myself for missing my self-appointed deadlines for practically everything I'm working on. I'm so stressed that all the muscles in my back are tense and constantly uncomfortable. To top it all off I have nobody to massage them for me.

 Add on car, bills, money, job applications, weddings, relatives, and graduation, and you have a fine mess.

 Why can't I be excited about graduation? I should be, but I just don't feel that way. I feel like I have nothing to look forward to, which is the cherry on top of the unhappiness cake which represents my life.

 That's all for now. I'm either going to keep working on my damned senior project or pass out trying. I'm so tired. Make it stop.
