Well, I just realized that Wayne has finally fixed the front page problems i mentioned in my previous post. That means I must post more to bump my old post out of existence. There are still a couple odd things about the archive features, but I'm sure you can navigate them and if not, I'm sure Wayne will iron them out soon.

 Anyway, on to the excuses. I spent a wonderful weekend these past few days in Northern Virginia visiting various relatives. I had a great time. In addition to having a great time, i didn't get any work done. Natrually Wayne didn't post, so that's why you haven't had a post in a few days.

 Anyways, on to miserable excuse for updated content. I have been working on a weapon model for Mimesis in the past week or two, "here":imageviewer.php?image=filespace/willow/mimesis/hand1.jpg and "here":imageviewer.php?image=filespace/willow/mimesis/gun1.jpg they are. I hope you enjoy. I hope to have it animated up sometime this summer. It looks like I'll have my modeling time the rest of this semester used up with other stuff.
