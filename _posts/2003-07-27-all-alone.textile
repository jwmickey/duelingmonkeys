Hey guys. Wayne is out of town on vacation all this next week, which basically means that I will be doing all the updates. At the same time, nobody will be here to remind me to update, which means I might be at work Monday morning, sitting at the info desk and realize that I should update but not have any idea what to show or talk about.

 Entirely hypothetical situation, of course.

 Right, sooo ...

 uhh, don't forget to read your "Strongbad e-mail":http://www.homestarrunner.com for today. Peace out.
