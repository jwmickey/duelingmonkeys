summary: "An arena shooter designed to double as a drinking game. Made for the 2008 Triangle Game Jam."
---
A video game designed specifically to be a drinking game. Double Beer Blaster is a two player game where players take turns with the controller. The player with the controller tries to manipulate the tap around the screen to fill up the floating beer mugs. The other player sits with a beer in each hand. When a mug gets filled in the game, the player sitting out takes a drink. After the round is over, players swap places to inflict sweet revenge.

Wes, Nick, and myself created this game over one weekend for the 2008 [Triangle Game Jam](http://www.trianglegamejam.com). The theme for that game jam was that we had to choose game concepts based off of titles that were randomly generated from three words from a pool of words provided by the participants. The other entries were Musical Dragon Twirler, Insane Manatee Fighter, and Pixelated Martini Roller. The game must be played with an Xbox 360 controller and basically controls like Geometry Wars.

The game that we made at the end of the weekend was ok, but I spent some additional time modifying the gameplay to require a little more skill and reflexes and adding some fancy graphical effects. Specifically, I created a full screen effect for doing meta-blobs which I think turned out pretty awesome. Hooray for programmable graphics hardware!
