summary: "Isometric action game where you run around and punch jelly"
---
The Blob Game is a simple game where you just run around in an isometric 2d tile map and when you are adjacent to one of the randomly generating bouncing jellies, you punch it and get a point. You have to get a certain number of points to progress to the next stage.

The gameplay was pretty terrible. The most entertainment you get out of it is from seeing how laughable the whole thing was. Despite how horribly crappy it was, I can tell I obviously put a lot of effort into it because it's pretty complete. It has things like story panels for each level with custom made pre-rendered 3d scenes, and a home made MIDI soundtrack.

I highly recommend that you do not play this game. I'm really just posting it here so that I can have some baseline for progress.

I've progressed a lot.
