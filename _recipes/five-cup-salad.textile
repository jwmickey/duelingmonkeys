h3. Comments

Five cup salad is a very unique side dish that goes great with any traditional grilling item. For all you whiney babies that see the words &quot;sour cream&quot; and run in fear, I say &quot;Sit down and eat!&quot; Your fears are totally unfounded. Just pretend like it's not sour cream, and you will never even notice it.

 It makes plenty, it's easier than a piece of cake, and it tastes great. Definately a recipe worth trying.
