This semester's schedule seems to be pretty slack, which is a radical change from last, one which was desperately needed. Anyway, because of that, hopefully I will find time to do some cool webpage stuff.

 The first of these things I found myself doing was creating a little icon for the webpage. I wanted it to be curvy, but getting photoshop to cooperate was a pain, so I ended up scanning the sketch I did in class and using it. Unfortunately, it turned out a little rough. I will have to re-work that later. If I can get my hands on 3D Studio Max any time soon, I will create a nifty intro logo animation. Cool, huh?

 In other news, because of my free time, I am trying to play with all the stuff I got for christmas, like my drafting table for drawing, Splinter Cell, Onimusha (I got that one for myself), and Unreal Tournament 2003. I was hoping to develop some stuff for UT, but the editor refuses to work on my computer. Additionally, I don't have 3D Studio Max, so I can't work on character models or static meshes either.
