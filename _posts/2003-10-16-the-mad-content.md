Consider yourselves lucky this friday. Us here at the dueling monkeys have been considerate enough to translate little snippets of our life into an amazing digital format for your viewing pleasure. I will divide this update into 3 parts, because we just have that much crazy content today.

 First up, Wayne took the time to bring some truths to light in his recent rant concerning [Jiffy Lube](/otc.html?view=specific&item=45). In my opinion, he was lenient on them, but I guess it would be foolish to believe that everyone who patronizes their hole gets the same problems that I do. I don't want to get started on Jiffy Lube, but I'm just going to say it took 3 entra trips to Jiffy Lube for them to fix the problems they created on the first.

 Jerks.

 Secondly, credit for this next item goes to wesley. He brought his cool little japanese digital camera to the climbing wall with us this past weekend, and we were able to capture some of it in the form of short quicktime movies. I hope you enjoy them. First is [yours truly performing a dynamic climbing maneuver](https://content.duelingmonkeys.com/filespace/wesley/mikesuperdyno.mov)!
 
Man, that's fun stuff. Then we have [Wesley performing the same move](https://content.duelingmonkeys.com/filespace/wesley/davedyno.mov). Then [me managing a difficult traversal](https://content.duelingmonkeys.com/filespace/wesley/miketraverse.mov). Isn't it cool? Yes.

 And just to point out how that first move is actually really easy and not dangerous at all, I have [this](https://content.duelingmonkeys.com/filespace/wesley/mikedynofake.mov), but don't tell anyone.

 Thirdly and finally, we come to what I've been working on. As you can see in my [modeling](galleries.php?section=modeling) and [game dev](galleries.php?section=game%20dev) galleries, I have an interest in 3d modeling for games. I haven't added to the galleries in a while, but that is not to mean I haven't been working. To remedy the lack of content, however, I finally finished up the important points of a new character model for project sunburn. Now you can see her in [all](https://content.duelingmonkeys.com/gallery/modeling/femalebodyrender4.jpg) [her](https://content.duelingmonkeys.com/gallery/modeling/femalebodyrender6.jpg) [glory](/classic/images/gallery/modeling/femalebodyrender7.jpg).

 Well, that might not be ALL her glory, but you'll never know, will you? Muah-hahahaha!

 More than enough stuff for one day. Now get you to the [messageboard](topics.php) and waste some more time.
