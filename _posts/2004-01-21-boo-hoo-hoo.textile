Well, it's thursday, and I haven't done anything since monday except stress out and worry about my &quot;real life&quot;.

 The "Game Developer's Club":http://www.gamedevelopersclub.org is in full swing with it's first annual game design contest, which is requiring more initial coordination than I planned. It's still a lot of fun though, and I'm sure it will all pay off when I get to see what the students are able to come up with.

 In the meantime, a class I'm taking finally forced me to read something out of a book. Despite my strict anti-literature policy, I was able to enjoy the reading quite a bit. I'm reading a non-fiction book called Angle of Attack, by Mike Gray. Ask me about it later in the semester and I'll let you borrow it.

 I'm also having to coordinate some other more troublesome GDC events that I don't really want to bitch about here. The point is that I didn't get any sleep tonight, and I'm in for a day full of classes. Oh well, I was probably going to sleep in class anyway.

 Since I haven't done anything noteworthy, I am forced once again to post a random link. This time it's a sweet little song sung by a cat in a little flash movie. Yay. "Shii's Song":http://www.albinoblacksheep.com/flash/shii.php
