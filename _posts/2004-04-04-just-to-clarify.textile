Sorry about all that crap I said last thursday. I just looked at the date and saw that it was april fools, so I felt like saying something silly.

 The truth is this: I still have an unimaginable amount of work to do, and will have no life until either A) I graduate, or B) I die trying.

 I guess if I died trying, I still wouldn't have a life. Scratch option B.

 Ironically, I did get a digital painting done later that night, but I probably won't post it because it doesn't really fit in and doesn't have a background or anything.

 I spent over 12 hours strait working on my game boy game on saturday. I added 800 lines to the program. It was an amazing feat, I felt so accomplished.

 There is not really a point to all of this, I just felt like clarifying my last post, and being sunday night, I noticed that nobody else decided to post so I figured I would fill the blank space.
