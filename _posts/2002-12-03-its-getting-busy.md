Wow. Things sure are getting busy around here. While I'd love to finish some more features of the site, I have 2 tests in Philosophy, a big final in Calculus, and a 27 page take home final in Discrete Math. Not to mention I'm speding an extra hour per night at work because of Christmas. So sadly, there won't be a whole lot going on here for a while. At least not on my part. I'm sure Willow will continue to post useless crap like this ;) Anyway, no more website stuff, no more staying up late wasting time, no more video games, no more sleeping... except for now, yeah I think I'll take a nap right now.

Don't you worry though, I'll be back all rested up for hours and hours of fun on the 13th.
