These past few days have been a real trial. If you noticed, I posted a rant on Software Engineering (it was listed as 2 days ago, but it's like 12:20 now, so I'm counting it as a day). The time that I wrote that rant and the due date of our final project were not close by coincedence.

 I truly hate that class and all the crap it has made me go through. I could have left to go home with my family for thanksgiving Tuesday afternoon (Nov. 26) if it weren't for this project. Instead, I spent all of yesterday and today trying to finish it. I finally got it done, and it looks good, but we are going to fail a lot of the test cases, so my grade will be less that stellar. But it's finished, and that's all I care about at this point. I would like to think this ends my trials and tribulations for this class, but the final still looms like a dark cloud on the horizon.
