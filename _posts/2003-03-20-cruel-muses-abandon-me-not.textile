Coming up with interesting update subjects is really quite entertaining. I suggest you try it sometime, I'm thinking of adding it to my list of hobbies. Anyway, once again I must declare myself a deciever, it seems to be happening more often these days. In this particular infraction, we shall discuss the subject of the subject (me) dicussing Japan.

 Well, I was supposed to write an update today (err, yesterday technically) about what Japan was like. Well, after sitting down at the keyboard ready to tell you all, I've come to a realization. Being immersed in a foreign culture is not really something that can be described. The real thing you get out of it is not just what you see or do, it is something completely indescribable. It's experience for your heart instead of your head.

 Anyway for that reason, I'm not reall going to say much other than if any of you have an opportunity to go abroad, you should take it with a vengeance. In other news, I'm hoping to work more on mimesis soon, so hopefully I will get some fresh screenshots out of what I've done. Come to think of it, I may want to make a gallery out of my game design work. Hmm... maybe later when I've got more to post.

 Expect pictures from Japan within the next year.
