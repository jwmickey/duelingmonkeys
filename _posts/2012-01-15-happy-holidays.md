Hey folks, so I forgot to update last month, my bad. Let's see if I can remember some of the stuff that happened:

* Made gingerbread house for the first time (I can remember)
* Celebrated Christmas at the Knutsons
* Celebrated Christmas again at my parents
* Happy birthday Amanda!
* Went to my cousin Amanda's wedding in Virginia and had a blast on New Year's Eve
* Went skiing with the Knutsons in Breckenridge for a week

It was all great fun and, as usual, I didn't take any pictures. However, I was able to find at least one picture of holiday festivites to share thanks to the facebook:

_I learned that perhaps the most important part of a gingerbread house is the path leading up to it_

Exciting news at work: we've released our iPhone game [Hero Academy](http://www.robotentertainment.com/games/heroacademy)! I think it turned out great. Although I don't have an iPhone, I do have an iPod touch at work that I can use for testing/playing so if you want to play me, send an invite to &quot;MikeD&quot;.

_Yo dawg, I herd you like tactics so I put tactics in your phone so you can stay awake while you sit in a meeting_

Also, I've gotten the chance to play a lot of video games in and around the holiday season. Here are the ones I'm working on (I recommend them all!):

* [Dark Souls](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_Souls)
* [The World Ends with You](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_World_Ends_with_You)
* [Super Mario 3D Land](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_3D_Land)
* [Mega Man Zero Collection](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mega_Man_Zero)
* [Advance Wars: Dual Strike](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advance_Wars:_Dual_Strike)
* [Cave Story](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cave_Story+) ([Steam](http://store.steampowered.com/app/200900/))
* [Jamestown](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamestown:_Legend_of_the_Lost_Colony) ([Steam](http://store.steampowered.com/app/94200/))
* [Bit Trip Runner](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit.Trip) ([Steam](http://store.steampowered.com/app/63710))

I don't know if it's sad or awesome that the wikipedia page on any given game is so much more useful than the game's official page. Anyway, see you next month.
