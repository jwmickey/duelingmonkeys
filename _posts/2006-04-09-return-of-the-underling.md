Wow... I exist!
 I did promise wayne to update like a month ago, but then forgot how, didn't really bother trying to find out, and now we end up not in smarch weather but smapril which will be the 14th month now that we are past the possibility of using the 13th (erroneous simpsons allusion).

 Anyway so I thought I would have content to post a long time ago, but as Willow mentioned I have moved to [California](http://chem.ucsd.edu/~anemecz/roadtrip-anime.gif), attend UCSD for my biochem PhD and thus have no time. But Wayne said he would post these roadtrip animations a long time ago (they are big so I understand and I have found another place to 'host' them) [_click_](http://chem.ucsd.edu/~anemecz/roadtrip-anime-small.mov).

 But really my main reason for posting is the one cool thing I have learned in grad school [sea snails are cool!](http://chem.ucsd.edu/~anemecz/fish2.avi). Heck I may have a chance to go diving in antarctica for a post-doc position (if I'm interested), but that is years down the road and there is no point to think about that, instead you should think about [your random link](http://yahooligans.yahoo.com/content/games/arcade/smart.html) or simply go back to your sudoku puzzle.
