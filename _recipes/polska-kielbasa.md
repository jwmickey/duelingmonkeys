### Ingredients

* Package of 6 sub-style wheat buns
* 1 Polska Kielbasa sausage link (duh)
* 1 pack slided mushrooms
* 1 block mozerella cheese
* 1 small to medium sized onion

### Directions

1. Start cooking the mushrooms and onions (slice the onion first) in a frying pan with a little olive oil.
1. Slice up the sausage. I suggest cutting it into 3-4 inch pieces and then slicing each piece vertically.
1. Fry the sausage in either another frying pan or The Foreman.
1. Grate your cheese (or you can buy shredded cheese if you want)
1. Preheat the oven to Broil.
1. Slice the buns vertically like they do at Subway (nothing fancy required)
1. When the mushroom and onions are cooked, the sausage is fried, and your cheese is grated, put it all inside the buns evenly, topping wtih cheese last
1. Put the finished product in the oven for about 2 minutes or until the cheese is melted. Don't forget about it or you will end up wirth burnt bread :)

### Comments

I think this is all there is to it. It serves 3 but Willow and I had no problem putting away all of it by ourselves. We were quite stuffed afterwards though. Let us know if you like this one or if you have any suggestions. Enjoy!
