If you don't like jalepeÃ±os, feel free to leave them out. We made the mistake of cooking three fresh ones, hence the name &quot;Breathless Burritos.&quot; Everyone in the house was coughing up their lungs because the spice in the air was taking such a toll on us. If someone dies as a result of our burrito instructions, we are not to be held responsible!

 Aren't they beautiful?
