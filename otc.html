    <h3>OTC (Our Two Cents)</h3>
    <p>
        Way back when, we had a section called OTC where we spilled out video game reviews, movie reflections,
        and general rants.  I am very bummed to report that we lost that data along the way.  I really would
        like to know what we had to say about movies and games, or what on earth we could hve to complain about
        back then as much younger versions of ourselves.  On second thought, it's probably for the best!
