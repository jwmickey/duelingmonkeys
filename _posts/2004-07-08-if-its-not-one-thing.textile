... you know the rest.

 Let me tell you a story. It goes a little something like this:

 It was a dark and stormy night in the little town of Blythewood. A cute couple with two young daughters sleep silently through the heavy rains. Only to awake to a flooded server room in nearby Columbia!

 Dun Dun Duuuuhhnnn!!!!

 The little server that could (host of duelingmonkeys.com, along with a few others) had to be drafted to fill in a position from a damaged server that actually did something useful. So Willow and I dug underneath the cushions, drank cheap beer, and robbed old ladies to scramble enough money to ship my older computer as a substitute. It's not as beefy as the previous one, but it should be able to hold up to the challenge.

 So there you have it folks; that's why the website has been down for the past two weeks. Sorry. I know you missed your dose of brain cell poison, but we will strive to make the next batch more potent, if you know what I mean.

 If you don't, then I guess you'll find out next time!
