My apologies for the long blackout. Let's catching up!

Let's see here, in the last 6 months (chronologically listed):

* Moved back to North Carolina!
* Started work at [Insomniac Games](http://www.insomniacgames.com)
* Worked on [Ratchet and Clank: Full Frontal Assault](http://www.insomniacgames.com/games/ratchet-clank-series/ratchet-clank-full-frontal-assault/), which has now shipped!
* Jody Mickey got married to Amanda Druck (/Mickey)!
* Attended the [2012 Triangle Game Jam](http://www.trianglegamejam.com/) and made the game [Exploding Slime Painter](/games/explodingslimepainter.html) with Michael Noland and Frank Voelker
* Got a Wii U (ok, Amanda got it but she said I can use it sometimes)
* It's 2013 now
* Went to Breckenridge Colorado for a Ski trip
* It snowed in Durham :)
* Revisited the game [Slither](/games/slither.html) to try a different control scheme and re-themed it as [Ammutseba](/games/ammutseba.html)
* Wedding planning is going fine

Man, I could have sworn that more stuff happened during that period. Well, I've got a new hobby project to pick out. See you later.
