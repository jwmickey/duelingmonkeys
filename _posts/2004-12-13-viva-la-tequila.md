Quin lo sabia? Pero yo finalmente fui a Mexico.
 So this monkey decided to infiltrate yet another country, and add another notch to the belt, during Thanksgiving. And how do you celebrate Thanksgiving in Mexico? With lots of [Tequila](#wastrelid2) and [Tortillas](#wastrelid2) of course!
 In case you didn't know, they actually don't celebrate Thanksgiving, but none-the-less we still followed tradition and ate a Thanksgiving dinner (ok so really it was baby back ribs, but at least everyone came out and we ate a huge meal), and shopped on Friday.

Really I went to Monterrey, the third largest, and richest mexican city there is. Thus the prices compared similarly with Raleigh, and really there was nothing to see except for the [Cola de Caballo](#wastrelid2) _'Horses Tail'_. Therefore mexico, _for me_, was simply a change in sceneray and friends and a relaxing time going out to clubs/bars!
 On a parlï¿½ franï¿½ais, un poco espaï¿½ol, and of course because of jason (who uses italian come on) english. So it was fun and mentally tiring switching between all the languages.

 Anyway enough rambling, [look at the pictures](galleries.php?section=Mexico&type=image)! And catch up on some spanish by reading calvin and hobbes [en espanol](http://www.ucomics.com/calvinandhobbesespanol/)
 If you want to hear more detail about the trip, with Austin, Texas included, then just [ask me](mailto:wastrel@duelingmonkeys.com).

 In other news, I've been kept busy and away from content making through the daily grind at Acronym central EPA in RTP working as a contractor in the ORD-APPCD _(I swear you can make a rap song out of these)_, and spending my sundays bartending. This leaves little free time when you throw in applications to graduate school, and just trying to hang out with friends I hardly ever get to see! But pictures are easy and I'm a wastrel so that's my content! _

 -peace_
