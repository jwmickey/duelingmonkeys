_Following is the accounts of our senior semi-foreign correspondant Wheedle concerning life in Hawaii_

 Why hello everyone. first let me start by introducing myself. i am the super cool honorary dueling monkey correspondant from HAWAII! i know Wesley is in japan, but hey - that just won't compare. i am a friend of Willow and Wastrel's from high school and lets just say i stuck - they like me too much. anyway, down to the good stuff! but first - this is my first post, so bear with my people!

 i guess i can start by saying hawaii just does not suck. it rocks. the weather is always above 82 F, it hardly ever gets cloudy and rainy, the beach is right across the street from my apt, there is planty of eye candy going around (both male AND female - i won't deny it, there are some hot chicks around this place), AND i get to go out on a boat everyday and jump in the pacific in hopes of seeing some awesome shit.

 for those not in the know - i'm working on a boat for the pacific whale foundation doing snorkel cruises and checking out turtles and dolphins. life is tough aint it? just the other day we saw a hawaiian monk seal that we all like to call &quot;humpy the monk seal.&quot; you might ask, why would you name a cute little seal humpy? well, i might answer, it is simply because these male seals are aggressive and like to mate with anything they see. yes, i said anything. a fellow crew member has been grabbed from behind by humpy while he tried to ... well, you know. so we arent without our fare share of ocean porn out here. spinner dolphins were also on the agenda last week and there will be pictures to share of those too.

 meanwhile, the downside of hawaii - gas is $2.65 a gallon, honey nut cheerios are $6 a box, bell peppers are $5 a pound, and most of my neighbors are old. but we still manage to have a kicking good time by ordering pizza, drinking beers, and making oven-made smores. (pictures to be seen - wayne is gonna help me with that)

 until next time, this is wheedle saying _aloooooohhhaaaaaa!_

 PS: everyone bug willow to make a &quot;me&quot; icon!

 _Hi, editor here. Hmm... looks like she already has an icon, oh snap! Repent, ye of little faith. Must say though, it doesn't do her justice._
