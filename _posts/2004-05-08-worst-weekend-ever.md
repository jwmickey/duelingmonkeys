I last -complained-, err updated on Friday. Since then, everything bad has gotten worse, and everything good ... was there anything good?

 Friday evening, I went to bed early (around 7) because I was exhausted. I set my alarm and got back up at midnight. Worked on the program until 8 AM; napped until noon. Went to CH graduation until 4; then worked on the program until 5 AM with a 2 hour break for the driving range. Wake up at 10 AM on Sunday. Work on program until 2. Work on thesis until 9. Short break. Work on math paper until ??? work on program until ??? study for graphics final ?

 I have scarcely left my room, made a proper meal, taken a shower, or gotten sleep in the past few days. All the muscles and bones in my body ache, I'm still sick, I'm tired, and I'm burned out. However, none of this is helping solve the problem of the F&#42;&#64;K!NG PROGRAM NOT WORKING RIGHT.

 My minigolf game (downloadable from [my portfolio webpage](/"http://mike.duelingmonkeys.com/")) is being expanded to play over the network. After endless reading, testing, and coding on the subject, my game now had 50% more lines of code than it did before. This is just rediculus. I can't start over, but this is too much. I can't make this program work. What should I do? Give up on my senior project and NOT graduate?

 To make things just a little more fun, I've basically been home alone all weekend too. Just chillin by myself, alone, miserable. I hate it. I'm not happy.
