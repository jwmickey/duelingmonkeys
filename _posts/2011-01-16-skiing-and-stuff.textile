Looks like I missed updating for the month of December. Sorry! Here are some exciting updates:

* Completed [Pinin Rodizo](/games/pinin-rodizo.html) phase 1!
* Added a games page for [Brixplorer](/games/brixplorer.html).
* Added Hawaii and Breckenridge pictures to the [Vacations](/gallery/mike-vacations) gallery.

Paul and I have decided to work on [Pinin Rodizo](/games/pinin-rodizo.html) for another phase, so hopefully in the next few months you can play a version with AI, network play, better gameplay, and better graphics.

### Skiing

Just recently I went snow skiing for the first time. Amanda invited me out with her family to [Breckenridge](http://www.breckenridge.com/) Colorado. I'm really glad I got to try it for three days - it got a lot more fun with each passing day so by the end of the third day it was really thrilling to go fast, unlike the first day where it was terrorizing to go faster than very slow. The mountains were really nice too. I look forward to the next time I get to go.

As far as the rest of life goes, I'm all moved in here in Texas now. My apartment is pretty nice. I'm not being as social as I probably should. Here's what I've been playing lately:

* [Age of Empires Online](http://ageofempiresonline.com/) beta
* [Starcraft 2](http://us.battle.net/sc2/en/)
* [Mass Effect 2](http://masseffect.bioware.com/) (although I'm losing interest)
* [Blight of the Immortals](http://blight.ironhelmet.com/)
* [Halo Reach](http://www.bungie.net/Stats/Reach/default.aspx?player=Willow%20Monkey)

Finally, here's a picture of Amanda and I hanging out:

_Look out behind you!_

Oh yeah, and Happy Holidays and New Years and all that stuff.
