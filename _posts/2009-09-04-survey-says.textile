So here are the tallies to the poll I took last update, including the votes of some people I talked too offline:

* Mario Kart: 6
* Release Connexus: 3
* Skills of an Artist: 2
* Release Orbital: 1
* Comic Game: 0
* Slack off: 0

Therefore, I will begin working on a Kart racing game soon. Stay tuned to see how things are progressing.

h3. Morning Hair

sometimes when I wake up in the morning my hair is very poofy. Sometimes I take pictures with my crappy digital camera. It's no "spinning beard picture":/2008/12/16/farewell-beard.html but it's still pretty funny to look at:

_It seemed a lot crazier at the time_




h3. Opus 17

I sat down with MUSAGI again earlier this week and wrote up a new piece of music. Please enjoy "Opus 17":/filespace/mike/Opus17.mp3 (if you can).

Oh yeah, it's also my birthday. I'm now 27. This will be my last birthday that is a whole cube number for a while
