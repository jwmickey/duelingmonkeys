I've been at the beach since Wednesday night dog and house sitting while my aunt and uncle are cruising around the BVI's. Normally I would say that the beach is a very unproductive work environment, but I spend many hours at a time without human contact and the weather has turned cold, so there's not much else to do other than watch Poseidon and [write a review](http://www.duelingmonkeys.com/articles.php?view=specific&item=56) about it. To those of you who say &quot;You're at the beach, stop complaining&quot; I say &quot;You're right, I'll move on&quot;.

 Willow has apparently been sidetracked during his journey to China (which I myself will embark on next week) due to a Typhoon that affected the entire air system in Japan. I assume he forgot to take Dave's phone number, so he had no way of contacting him to let him know that he would not be arriving on time, or at all in the 24 hours after he was supposed to arrive. Good work Mike!

 On Tuesday, I will drive back to Raleigh, possibly back home to drop off the dog, and pack for China. The total flight time is about 18 hours. I would take my laptop to watch a movie, but the battery would not last long and then I have an excuse to do work while on vacation (boo!). I expect to spend a few dollars on drinks during my layover in Detroit so I can prepare to sleep as much as possible, but who knows what will happen.
