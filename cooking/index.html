    <h3>Cooking!</h3>
    <p>
        Back when we started this site, the cooking section was dedicated to recipes for lazy, broke, and inept college students.  Things
        have changed (even if it's just a little).  So, keep those quick and easy recipes coming, but don't limit yourself to them!
    </p>
    <p>
        I don't think any recipes have been added in a very long time, and I don't expect them to come, so the ability to login
        and add your own no longer exists.  However, it is no biggie for us to add one ourselves, so if you have something
        you want to share, please contact one of us and we'll get it on the site.
