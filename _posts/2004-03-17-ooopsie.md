Ok, so I was busy producing brown glass last night and apparently forgot to update. It's not really much of a suprise that nobody else remembered either.

 I'm in a lab on campus right now, so even if I had something to add, I wouldn't be able to upload it. Now you know.

 I guess I'll end this little post with some advice about mexico: If someone offers you free all you can eat tacos, they probably suck. If you are offered free all you can drink cerveza, on the other hand ...

 Peace out
