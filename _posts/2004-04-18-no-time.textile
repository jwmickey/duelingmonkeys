I don't have time to do this. I didn't have time to upload "the photos":http://www.duelingmonkeys.com/galleries.php?section=cruise&type=image I put in the gallery. And then I definately didn't have time to resize the originals to something you can see on your computer screen. I'll do that later. Much later.

 I'm really getting nervous about being able to finish everything required of me by the end of the semester. I just can't get in the groove of things, and every time I get close, I run into a new problem or obstacle. This has to stop soon, right?

 Sorry about the images, everything will eventually be moved to the other gallery once we do a site redisign this summer (maybe).

 Somebody email me and tell me everythings gonna be alright.
