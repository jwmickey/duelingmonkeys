I have had 2 consecutive nights of really wierd dreams. Mulitple dreams in one night that have nothing to do with each other.

 Last night in one dream there were lots of snakes running around. I hate snakes. Almost as much as Willow hates spiders. In another dream I was driving my first car. I miss changing gears.

 Now that I'm trying to write about my dreams, I can't really remember them. The point is, the past 2 nights I have been putting on music from Cirque Du Soleil and going to sleep with it playing all night. I'll continue this and see what kind of crazy stuff my brain dreams up tonight.

 I was going to write a rant, but I'm going to take a nap instead. When I do get it up you'll get to take a look at some really cool artsy stuff I can do (or can't).
