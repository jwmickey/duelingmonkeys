Well, in remotely-site-related events, I colored a new picture for the gallery! Oh wait, we don't have a gallery yet. I actually made a gallery page, but Wayne took it down because It wasn't dynamic enough, so now I have no way of showing you my new picture.

 I guess it's not really that important anyway, I just wanted to feel like I've done something meaningful. At least I'm doing my part, I tell myself. Good job, Willow. Anyway, in other meaningless news, the snow I wrote ecstatically about earlier quickly turned to ice and coated everything outside. It was really beautiful even when it started pulling down trees on top of roads, cars, and powerlines, but now that it has melted and the trees are still fallen, it just plain sucks.
