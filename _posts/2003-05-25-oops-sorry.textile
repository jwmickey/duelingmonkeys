I was out of town for the weekend, and I didn't get back in until tonight, hence the lack of update continuity. Natrually Wayne didn't think to post, but Wayne is a busy important guy with other things to do, whereas I am not.

 Anyway, considering I was in northern Virginia all weekend (I do not live in northern VA), I haven't had any time to do anything meaningful, however, I will show you somthings I believe are worth showing...

 Oh yeah, that reminds me ... well, it doesn't really remind me, but I just remembered, so it's kind of like it ju-&#42;SMACK&#42;

 Oh, right. I would like to present to you "Gotham Girls":http://www2.warnerbros.com/web/gothamgirls/home.jsp. This is a little 10 part mini-series of flash movies about the female characters of Batman's Gotham City. Let me get one thing strait: I hate batman, the cartoon show that these little flash movies is based off of is a bunch of crap. However, nothing can keep me from loving this series, mainly because it ignores the most blatant problem with the cartoon: Batman. Anyway, it's the most well done flash I've ever seen. Enjoy.
