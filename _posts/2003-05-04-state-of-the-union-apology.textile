I think that yesterday's post epithomizes our role in this site: making posts that make no sense and serve as mere excuses for updates. I have fun doing it, but I don't know if you do. I will make ammends by making another post that makes no sense (what you are reading now) and give an excuse for an update. So I wrote another review, this time on "Gunvalkyrie":http://www.duelingmonkeys.com/otc.php?view=specific&item=29. In other news, someone finally took my pictures from Japan to get developed, so sometime in the near (read: distant) future, I should be putting up a new gallery.

 To conclude, for all of you out there are reading this after they get to work in the morning because you apparently don't have anything better to do, check out the excellent webcomic "Angel Moxie":http://www.angelmoxie.com. It's excellent drawing style was inspiring. While you are at it, you can check out the same artist's other comic "Rebus: Heroes for Hire":http://www.venisproductions.com/rebus/index.html, which is also excellent. Peace out.
