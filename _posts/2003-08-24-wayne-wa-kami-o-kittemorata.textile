that means Wayne got his hair cut. i think. my japanese is a little rusty (and by rusty i mean was never there to begin with). so, what have we for you today? pictures of Waynes new do! "haircut 1":images/gallery/snapshots/wayne_haricut1.jpg, "haircut 2":images/gallery/snapshots/wayne_haircut2.jpg, and yes, even "haircut 3":images/gallery/snapshots/wayne_haircut3.jpg!!!

yes well, wasn't that fun. if you see him try not to laugh out loud (yes, it will be difficult. trust me, i know), try to at least wait until he isn't looking. he still doesn't know!

 if you want a haircut, just let me know and i'll make you an appointment at Wesley's Salon. (mention this article and get a discount!)
