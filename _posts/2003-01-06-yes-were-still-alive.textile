It's been quite some time since either of us has posted anything. No &quot;Merry Christmas wishes&quot; or &quot;Happy New Years&quot;. Willow is out of the country, but I have a load of worthless excuses... Be prepared:

 Work was really busy during Christmas, and I was never in a good enough mood to post anything worth reading (have we even done that yet?). I had to do a lot of driving for the holidays and spent little time on the computer. The time I did spend was on something unrelated to the site. I do have a recipe coming up for some awesome chicken pizza, but I must say that the chicken alone would be just as yummy. I'll try to get it up soon, but it's not my recipe and I can't remember the ingredients for the marinade.

 Don't worry loyal readers, Willow will be back in a couple of days to fill your screen with more useless rambling. Be patient.
