If you are a person who desires to dance like the pros - using your stunning body movements to inspire attractive members of the opposite sex to adorn you with their bodies ... we can in no way help you with that. Sorry. However, if you want to know how to dance like a machine-operated stick-puppet; well, there we might be able to help.

 You see, Wastrel and I decided to implement a little animation project a while ago (a very long while ago, actually) and we have finally finished it. I've always had an interest in art; I've experimented with 3d modeling, 2d art, animation, and music; and this project seemed like a good way to put it all to use to make something. The idea was to make some 3d models of stick-puppets (in the image of your's-truly) and have them dance to music. The intended irony of this is, of course, that stick puppets are rigid, and therefore do not dance in any way.

 That simple irony is what convinced me to propose the idea, but, unfortunately I didn't realize at the time that the joke would take a total of about 5 seconds to tell and wear off. Not taking this post-production realization into account, we planned a 2-minute movie short. We more than planned it, we implemented it. Now we are done and you all get to see it.

 I guess what I was trying to say in that last poorly-worded paragraph is that I don't really know what the point of this animation is anymore. It's not really funny, so if you watch it you'll just have to try hard to appreciate the fact that we followed through with such a thing. Trying to derive entertainment from that thought might be your best bet to enjoy it.

 Anyway, enough blabber. Here is the video:

 I think that we'd like to make more videos like this. Now that we have learned from the first, I think we can make the next installments more entertaining. If you guys have any ideas or suggestions, please let us know! For your convenience, I've created a messageboard topic concerning the subject - c'mon, it's easy!

 Well, that's all I'll say for now. Work is still fun. Catch you on the flip-side.
