The liquor cabinets are full, tans all about, and plenty of -women- stories to go around!

As you all should well know after a week long break we have each done nothing, and hence nothing really cool to provide for those content thriving viewers. On the other hand lots and lots of pictures, so I have the privelege of giving you folks a small "peak":http://www.duelingmonkeys.com/galleries.php?section=Spring%20Break into one of the Monkeys' Spring Break Extravaganzas.

And for the Grand Finale of this grand reopening we have "something not so cool":http://www.duelingmonkeys.com/filespace/wastrel/Gimpy_Jump.MOV (_The camera somehow messed up and did not properly record one of the jumps, and of course which one? The *cooler bigger* one at the bottom!!!_).
 Well, I hope each and everyone has enjoyed their 'Spring' Break and have nonstressful returns to their studies/jobs.
 _-peace_
