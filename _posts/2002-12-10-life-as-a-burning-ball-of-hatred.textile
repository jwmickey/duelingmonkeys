My hatred and desire to hunt down and destroy all things relating to computers seems to have taken a dive. This is surely not a coincidence as it coresponds to the completion of my software engineering final exam. Whenever I saw a monitor for months I wanted to smash it because of the pains that class has caused me. But finally, I, a now bruised and battered wretched creature, have escaped the clutches of my devious tormentors to try and rebuild my life from the scraps that remain. Perhaps there is hope that I will be able to complete my degree now.

 Just to put things in perspective: I am a good student. Up to this point, my major GPA was a 4.0. I attended every software engineering lecture, studied for every test, and did every homework. Despite my best efforts, I will get a C in this class. I tried getting in touch with my teacher to give her some feedback on what I was having trouble with, and she threw it back in my face. Now my 4.0 major gpa will drop, never to return. Do you know how great it would have been to boast a 4.0? I guess I'll never know now that mine is permanently ruined by a black-hearted teacher.

 Memory of hatred returning ... must stop before computer destroyed ...
