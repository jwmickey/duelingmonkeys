### Comments

I'm sure this would be good with chicken or pork instead of steak. You don't have to be exact with the ingredients; the original recipie called for more stuff but I didn't have it and left it out. I was very pleased with the results.

 If you have someone helping to dice the veggies and meat, it makes it twice as easy.

 Don't overcook the meat, just get it done.
