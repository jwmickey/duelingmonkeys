Well friends, it has been a long time once again. First off, Willow mentioned that there was no news archive anymore. I hadn't even noticed. I added a cheap news archive search, but only by date. I would add search by title but it's rare that titles are relevant, and even more rare that anyone would use it. The link to the news archive is on the right side of the front page before and after the latest news.

In other news, not much exciting going on with me these days. My sister was in town this weekend and we went to the Jimmy Buffett concert, which was a good time, but I overdid it a bit. Not that it means much to those of you who are a few years older than me, but after that crazy party I can safely say, &quot;I'm not as young as I used to be.&quot;

In other news, I started another blog at "jodymickey.com":http://www.jodymickey.com geared strictly towards programming related posts. I thought about just having a section on this site for it, but I figured it would be easier and better to separate the two, and I wanted to register my name for the domain name while it's still available. That blog will probably have a boring level equal to this post, but feel free to follow along if you are that bored.

Alright folks, that's it for me. Stay out of the heat.
