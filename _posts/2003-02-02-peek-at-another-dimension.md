Well, Wayne recently helped me aquire a drawing tablet. In case you know not what they are, it's an interface device with you computer where it puts the mouse cursor wherever you put your pen on a pad. This is helpful for drawing and coloring things in photoshop, which, in case you haven't noticed, I'm rather fond of. Wacom makes the best, but they are expensive. I'd have to pay about $350 to get a decent, but very small one.

 To make a long story short, mine is a $24 piece of crap. It has issues that make it very frustrating and limiting. However, i am beggining to see it's advantages that simply can't be done with just a mouse. So, I've enjoyed it so far. Without any new art handy to color as a test, I shuffled through the random papers on my desk, and came across [this](https://content.duelingmonkeys.com/filespace/willow/evilwillowsketch.jpg) concept sketch for the character of Willow for this webpage. I decided it didn't really fit me well, so I didn't use it, but it was fun to digitally ink and color. [Here](https://content.duelingmonkeys.com/filespace/willow/evilwillow.jpg) is the final result of my toil. The most apparent place where you can see the pressure sensetivity advantage is in the background, but it came in pretty handy throughout.

 In other news, I've been working on building a city level in Unreal Tournament 2003 for an AI research presentation. It's a lot of fun, and I've been making a lot of progress, but I'm not very far yet. I'll make and post some screenshots when I'm further.

 Peace out, and piss off.
