Hey all, a lot has happened over the past 2 months.

h3. China 2011

Amanda and I finally got around to going to China together in September! It was a really awesome vacation consisting of things like:

* Visiting my brother Dave and his family including new niece Kaylin! (super cute)
* Taking a train out to an old water town for a day (temples, gardens, and hunt for non-sketchy food)
* Visiting Old Town Shanghai (fancy tea house, dumplings, and cool gardens)
* Tallest observation deck in the world
* Pixar museum
* Tasty breakfast buns and Happy Lemon bubble tea

I even added a few of the pictures to the "China Gallery":/gallery/china.

h3. Orcs Must Die!

So the game I spent much of this year working on FINALLY came out. I'm really proud of "Orcs Must Die!":http://www.robotentertainment.com/games/orcsmustdie. It's a really fun game, and I'm not even the only one that thinks so, it's getting great reviews as well. EVERYONE SHOULD BUY 10 COPIES!

Lucky for me, Amanda was visiting Texas the weekend of the release party, which resulted in this awesome pictue:

One thing that was not so awesome about that weekend was that I got all 4 wisdom teeth removed right before it. Once again, I was lucky to have Amanda around to help me out with that.

As for what I'm working on, I've been having tons of fun doing preproduction for future projects, although what they are must remain a mystery for now

h3. New car

After Amanda left the weekend of the OMD release party, I managed to get in a pretty serious car accident that totalled my old 98 Honda Accord. It seems that neither myself nor the guy that hit me have any permanent damage which is really fortunate considering the state of our cars.

So that meant renting a car, doing a bunch of research, then setting out the next weekend to find a new one. I considered many different types of cars, went on a few test drives and haggled with a bunch of salesmen until finally settling on a 2012 Honda Accord LX.

Well, I think that's about enough for one update. See you all later.
