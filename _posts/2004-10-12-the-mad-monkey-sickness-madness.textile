its kind of like mad cow disease. ...except with monkeys. except NOT like mad cow disease, more like the flu. damn, i knew i should have dressed up like a fragile old lady and gotten that vaccine. anyway, back to the point, Willow Monkey and myself are sick. Wayne is soon to follow. (no really, i backwashed into his drink when he wasn't looking.) and we not enjoying it, not one bit.

 so, thats all i have to say. *_BUT_* instead of leaving you hanging like that, i'm going to direct you to "Engrish.com":http://www.engrish.com/, where you can help us pick out our new motto;"Monkey Bros.":http://www.engrish.com/recent_detail.php?imagename=monkeybros.jpg&category=Bags/Packaging&date=2004-09-17, "Calm Down Monkey":http://www.engrish.com/recent_detail.php?imagename=calm-down-monkey.jpg&category=Clothing&date=2004-09-15, or "Banana":http://www.engrish.com/recent_detail.php?imagename=banana.jpg&category=Snacks&date=2004-09-16.

 and now i'm off to bed, undoubtedly to awake in a pool of my own snot cause my nose has turned into the incredible unstopable faucet of mucus! come see it now! ...actually, don't.
