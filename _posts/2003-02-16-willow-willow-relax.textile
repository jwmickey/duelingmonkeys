If you haven't noticed, Willow likes to post about as much as I like to complain about work. If he would ask, &quot;Hey Wayne, is there a way to convert a wmv to mpeg?&quot; I'd say, &quot;probably, I found a tool that converts wma to mp3 the other day, why don't you try "this handy site":http://www.google.com.&quot; But no, Willow's first thoughts are, &quot;I'll go whine about it to all 3 of my readers.&quot;

 Ok, ok, I'm being a bit harsh. This was really just leading up to me rubbing in the fact that it was sleeting all night and Willow had to ride the "CAT bus":http://www.duelingmonkeys.com/otc.php?view=specific&item=14 to work today, while all but one of my classes was cancelled per order the teacher (by the way, the roads are slick you retards who only delayed classes) and I just don't ride the "CAT bus":http://www.duelingmonkeys.com/otc.php?view=specific&item=6 for one class.

 Ok, back to bed for me
