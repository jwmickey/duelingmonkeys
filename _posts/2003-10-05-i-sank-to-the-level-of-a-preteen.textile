Hey, so its sunday night, we all have work out the bum, and well we didn't get much of anything accomplished this weekend. Although Sleep is quite an accomplishment, and I definetly caught up on that (especially with random naps which were not planned and just took precious hours out of a good day).

Anyway the point of this post is that last week I watched 'A Knight's Tale,' on my own without female companionship, and of my own free will as well. Yes I realize my utter stupidity. And so here is my "Reflection on the modern 'classic'":http://www.duelingmonkeys.com/otc.php?view=specific&item=44.

The only mistake I admit to was believing my female friends in that it is good and not listening to my gut instinct of movie stupidity.
    &amp;nbspAnyway the comic will be coming soon _I have more work to do so...
-peace out_
