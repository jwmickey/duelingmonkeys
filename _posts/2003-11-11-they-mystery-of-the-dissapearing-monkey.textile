and here you are, a mystery update! yes, those hardy boys would love this. so where has our beloved Wesley Monkey been all this time? here's your first clue, it starts with H and ends in ELL. 'school work thats more than two weeks overdue hell' that is (its inbetween the 3rd and 4th levels of regular hell). in fact, he's still there now. maybe someday he will escape, but the future looks bleak.

and why is he writing in the third person you might ask? because he is dictating this message to me, Procrast Inate, Lord of the Evil Research Paper, while he is weeping like a little school girl over a pile of books (the weeping might also be a result of me rubbing lemon juice in his eyes, muahahahaha...). so let this be a lesson to ye! do your papers on time (or pay someone else to do them for you on time), or you will be spending time with ME!!!! MUAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA......

oh, and check out "Procrast's Empty Fridge Special":cooking.php?view=specific&item=34 for a new cooking idea! and to all of you who are no longer in school, feel free to ridicule Wesley, poor tortured soul that he is.
