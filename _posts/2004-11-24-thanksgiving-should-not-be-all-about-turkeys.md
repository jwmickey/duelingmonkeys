i mean really, turkey is over-rated. and cranberry sauce? uugh! well anyway, that all aside, we here in the monkey household would like to wish anyone out there who happens across our humble webpage a very convivial (yea, you know you don't know what that means) thanksgiving! eat whatever you like, but try and expand beyond the stereotypical thanksgiving dogma of pilgrams with blunderbusses chowin down on turkey with cranberry sauce. personally i prefer the honey baked ham. oh oh, and twice baked potatoes of my mothers own recipe. mmm... drive safely wherever you may be, and meet us back here next week for a jolly christmas rant.

 what, you were expecting something [more](http://www.albinoblacksheep.com/flash/monkeybeer.php?)
