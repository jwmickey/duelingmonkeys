I can't believe it, but it's snowing in Raleigh. Snow makes me so giddy. It truly is a pathetic sight to see. I don't konw what to do with myself now, I think I'll wrap up in a warm blanket by a window with a hot drink and relax.

 No wait, finals are next week. This in itself woudn't be too much of a problem, but there is an unfotunately large amount of other things that I should get done by the end of the semester that also nag away my time. Oh well, what can you do? I'll probably watch the snow anyway.
