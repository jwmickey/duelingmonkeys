Well, I have finally returned from my holiday adventures, and ... well, ... I don't really have anything new to say. I was thinking of writing another reflection on modern classics concerning final fantasy, but that's a lot of work and I have two new games to play, so don't expect it anytime soon. Other than that, the IGDA had another meeting last night. It was great. Um... I'm bored of writing, piss off.
