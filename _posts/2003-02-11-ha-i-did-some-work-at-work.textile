When it rains, it pours. So I had to sit at the information desk for a significant portion of my job today. This means that I sit in front of a computer answering a phone with some contrived question about the university once about every 15 minues. This leaves a lot of time to do other stuff, and saying as I already exhausted the entire internet, I thought I might add some stuff to the site.

 At first, it was just an update, but I realized I had more time on my hands, so I wrote 3 game reviews. I was on a roll. Anyway, in case you were wondering about these specific Xbox titles, check out [Splinter Cell](http://www.duelingmonkeys.com/otc.html?view=specific&item=22), [Panzer Dragoon](http://www.duelingmonkeys.com/otc.html?view=specific&item=23), and [Genma Onimusha](http://www.duelingmonkeys.com/otc.html?view=specific&item=24).
