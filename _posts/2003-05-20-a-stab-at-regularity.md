Is what this is. I'm very proud of myself you see, I wanted to make a post on wednesday, so I spent tuesday making stuff to post! I'm not going to refer to today as either because I'm in that grey area that could be either depending on your time zone.

 Right, anyway, I was playing with this software synthesizer I have and, once again, found an ancient throw-away project that I could convert to mp3 after a bit of tweaking. I originally wrote this in the spring of 1999, crazy, no? Without further ado, I give you [Nameless Opus](https://content.duelingmonkeys.com/filespace/willow/namelessopusshort.mp3). Hm... maybe I should come up with a name for it. If you have any suggestions, natrually you should [let me know](feedback.php).

 Wait! That's not all! Today (and today only (probably) ) you don't just get one tidbit of content update... For a limited (read: indefinite) time, you will get not one, but TWO tidbits of content! What I'm referring to here is a program download that represents the code I finally got working for my game engine. This is just a small portion of the engine, specifically the part that deals with static structures. Really, I don't expect anyone to appreciate the programming that goes into this, but you can at least check out my cool tower. Right, [here it is](https://content.duelingmonkeys.com/filespace/willow/staticmesh.zip). Just a couple notes first, though (why do I always forget this part till after I post the link?), it's compressed in a zip file, so you'll need to be able to break one of those open, and additionally, it requires you have [DirectX 9](http://www.microsoft.com/directx) installed. Unfortunately, you can thank vsual sudio for an enormous exe size - thanks visual studio.

 That's it my little grease monkeys, now come back friday.
