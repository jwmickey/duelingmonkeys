In our original site design we had a downloads section. Eventually, it became clear to us that we didn't make enough stuff to warrant such a section, so we removed it. What I had always wanted, though was a place to let people hear my music. I don't suppose it would hurt that much to just post it here.

 Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you "my organ music":/filespace/willow/organpractice.mp3. I must explain a little about this, though. I was playing around with audio effects and exports, and I found this old abandonned opus I started over 3 years ago. It was simple and straitforward, so I used it as an expariment and this is how it turned out. Aditionally, I made this "techno version":/filespace/willow/techorgan.mp3 that you may also find interesting. I tried to post a whole music piece, but I couldn't get access to the ftp and I'm not sure what that might do to our bandwidth usage.

 Hopefully, there will be more in the weeks to come. If you like what you hear, please feel free to "let me know":mailto:willow@duelingmonkeys.com.
