Wayne and I love to rant about how stupid aspects of our society can be, but now we are proudly able to diversify our pool of complaints to our society AND France. Our senior foreign correspondant in France, Wastrel, has been kind enough to give you all a little insight as to what it is to live in another part of the world.

 So, head over to "rants":otc.php?view=rant and check out "La Gr√®ve":otc.php?view=specific&item=34. In other news, I have started project sunburn, in theory I should be working on it for about 20 hours a week, which means for you that I should be producing a boatload of new pictures and screenshots. Keep your eyes out.

 And on one last note, don't foget to do something for father's day.
