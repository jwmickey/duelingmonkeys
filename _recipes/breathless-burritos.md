### Ingredients

* 1 can black beans

* 4 cups shredded lettuce
* 1 or 2 jalepeÃ±o peppers
* 2 cups shredded cheese
* Sour cream

### Directions

1. Dice peppers and heat in skillet with olive oil, stirring throughout
1. Brown ground beef in second skillet

1. Once meat is browned, add beans. Simmer for another few minutes, just long enough to heat the beans

1. Enjoy!

### Comments

If you don't like jalepeÃ±os, feel free to leave them out. We made the mistake of cooking three fresh ones, hence the name &quot;Breathless Burritos.&quot; Everyone in the house was coughing up their lungs because the spice in the air was taking such a toll on us. If someone dies as a result of our burrito instructions, we are not to be held responsible!

 Aren't they beautiful?
