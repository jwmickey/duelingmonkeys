Wayne and I have finally gotten around to cooking something with the intention of adding it to the site. We tried to make Belgian Waffles this morning (err ... afternoon), but they didn't come out as good as we thought they would. We ended up eating eggos for the latter half of the meal.

 I don't think we are going to reccommend anything that can so easily be beat by eggos, so we're not going to post any waffle recipes yet.
