and now this semester. These are things that hurt me so much to think about that it infuriates me. Every time one of them comes to mind, my mind fills with rage. Why have the cruel fates allowed such things into my life?

 I don't like using this site as an avenue for constant complaints, but this morning I feel the need to vent, so get ready to endure it.

 I now hate school. I wish to do almost anything to get out of it. Anything that doesn't involve the brutal sacrifice of my own career. Specifically, I hate english classes. I have three this semester. I hate english. I also hate my cranky old opinionated bastard graphics teacher. I could have enjoyed the class if you had been a nice guy and died before I took it.

 In the past week, I have had to pull three all-nighters out of necessity for schoolwork. In addition to that, I didn't even get my work finished, so I have the added stress of finishing a paper and a program to minimize their late-ness.

 To summarize, I feel the way I look in [this awful picture](/classic/images/gallery/halloween%202003/devildayafter.jpg).

 Okay, sorry for all that depressing-ness. The Dueling Monkeys household held a little gathering for Halloween, which was a decent success. In honor of our own greatness, we added some pictures of the event to a new gallery: [Halloween 2003](galleries.php?section=halloween%202003). Yeah, it's cool. I was the man [until I remembered how much work I didn't finish beforehand](/classic/images/gallery/halloween%202003/devildayafter.jpg).

 In other news, for those of you it concerns, Wayne has fixed up the crazy [movies exchange](http://movies.duelingmonkeys.com) so that you can edit the movies you have already added, so Mr. Muffin can go back and fix all of those horrible spelling errors if he feels so inclined. Wayne has also been busy making the new [Game Developer's Club](http://www.gamedevelopersclub.org) webpage function. Although Wayne takes credit for creating all of the original code that makes it tick, I can claim responsibility for stealing the graphics from some obscure video game, which will no doubt NOT get me in legal trouble with an evil, international super-corporation.

 Yikes. This is a horrible update. I guess I'd better bring it to a close before it gets any worse.
