I had all day today all to myself to do whatever I wanted. I figured I hadn't done a comic for the page in quite a long time, so I'd go ahead and do that one for Final Fantasy VIII that I've been meaning to. How did it turn out? [Absolutely horrible.](/classic/images/comic/finalfantasy2.jpg)

 In addition to managing to be not funny, it also represents some of the worst artwork I've done in recent times. The drawings of my characters are extremely inconsistent from frame to frame, and I am really just posting it to remind myself of how shameful I should feel for not practicing my characters in too long. Oh well, what can you do? Maybe some other slow day I can make a redemtion picture that will make up for it. In the meantime, I will just have to live with sucking.

 As usual, you can tell us what you think about he new comic [here](feedback.php). Have a nice day.
