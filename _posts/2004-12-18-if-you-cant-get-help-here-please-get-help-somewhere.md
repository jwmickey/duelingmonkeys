Today I will warn you of the horrible dangers involved in cycling. On the street, cycling is known as 'riding the bike'. Well, hopefully you already don't do bike, but if you do, you may find the following materials enlightening.

 I hope you enjoyed that. To give it some context, I made up that pamphlet as a gag gift for a co-worker who is really into biking. In it's original form it was printed on one sheet front and back with three panels each side. I arranged the panels into the order you would read them on the pamphlets when I put them up here.

 I would also like to post a rant about Kinko's but I'm too lazy to write one. Besides, they don't even deserve it they are so crappy. You don't want to know how much I had to pay to get that damn thing printed out.

 I'm going to be heading out of town as of this coming thursday. After that, I'll be away from any means of updating for a long time. There is a chance that Wayne will have a little suprise for you by then, but if you don't see it soon, you can consider the front page of Dueling Monkeys closed for the holidays (by all means continue using the messageboard) There is a small chance, however, that you might hear an update from me coming from the sunny state of Hawaii! I'll be chillin with Wheedle for about 10 days at the beginning of January.

 Extra thanks to Sam and Cynthia for hosting a great party last Saturday. Wayne and I are going to dive into some tasty cheese and sausage as soon as he gets home tonight.

 I'm going to do more than finish this post off with a plain old random link. I seem to recall that on Saturday there was a discussion on what webcomics were good. At the time, I think I had a little bit too much honey lager in me to recall all of mine so I'll do you all the favor of posting them here. Following are all of my favorite webcomics in no particular order.

 [VG Cats!](http://www.vgcats.com/)
