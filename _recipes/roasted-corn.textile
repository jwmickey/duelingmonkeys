h3. Comments

Okay, so corn on the cob isn't exactly rocket science, but this is a different way of cooking it and the garlic gives it a good kick, but not too strong. I think I like this corn better than boiling it. I'd imagine that Silverqueen corn would be just as good or better, but Yellow corn is more readily available at the grocery store.
