h3. Ingredients

* 2 boneless skinless chicken breasts (either fresh cut or for a lot less money, the bagged chicken is pretty tasty too)
* "Moore's Marinade":http://www.mooresmarinade.com

h3. Directions

# Soak thawed chicken breasts in marinade for 30 mintues to one hour. This marinade only needs this amount of time, so marinading for 8 hours or more is not neccessary and doesn't really help.
# Cook chicken until center is no longer pink

h3. Comments

The marinade has a really good flavor. I got home from work, put the chicken in the marinade, took a shower, and by the time I got done, the chicken had soaked in plenty of flavor. Cleanup was a breeze.

 We had it with "broccoli and cheese":cooking.php?view=specific&item=28 and applesauce.
