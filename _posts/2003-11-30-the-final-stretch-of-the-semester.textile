is upon us. This means that I only have one semester to go before I am free of school forever. More specifically, free from english. I never have to take an english class again as of one week from today. Hooray!

 I hope everyone had a happy thanksgiving. Enjoy those leftovers. I know that I had a good break, it was just what I needed to get my spirits up. I'm probably going to get a new computer soon, so that should be awesome. I'm not sure if that will mean I will want to spend more time playing with 3d studio and photoshop (now that they are faster) or just playing more games (because they are prettier). Either way, I'm going to be happier.

 I'm working a bit on my motorcycle model (for UT2k4), but it won't be ready for a very long time. I'll let you know when I get anything in the gallery. However, I did dig up some old models I've been meaning to put in the modeling gallery: "behold":imageviewer.php?image=images/gallery/modeling/facerender2.jpg, the "heads":imageviewer.php?image=images/gallery/modeling/facerender3.jpg.
