So I am going to tell you something that I did a while ago. Before I state what I did, I am going to preface by saying that the following statment is literally true:

 I killed a spider by casting Spells of Fury at it.

 I'll let that sink in for a sentence. If that is literally true, does that make me a real life _wizard_?

 If you are an acute reader, you may note that Spells of Fury is capitalized. The trick to my statement is that Spells of Fury is a proper noun. It is the title of a book that I threw at a spider to squash it. So I indeed killed a spider by casting Spells of Fury at it. I thought I would share that because it was funny (to me, at least; Wayne didn't think it was funny)

 Another thing that is funny is the book 'Spells of Fury' itself. No, it's not a D&amp;D manual. The subtitle reads: &quot;Building Windows 95 Games Using DirectX 2&quot;. It has chapters with such AWESOME titles as &quot;Chapter 5: DirectSound: Enter the Realm of the Queen of the Night&quot;, and &quot;Chapter 7: Recipes for Destruction&quot;. Needless to say, this is a pretty awesome book.

 Man, people that work on video games must be _dorks_!

 Last week I broke out the ol' tablet and made a new digital painting. I think it turned out pretty good. I'll go ahead and apologize in advance for the background. I only spent a few minutes on it:

 I think that about sums it up for now. I can't say that I have a whole lot else to report. Catch y'all later!
