    Mike Daly here. Trying to make video games has been a hobby of mine for many years now. We put
    together this page so that I could document and share them.
</p>

<p>
    Although making games is great fun; unfortunately, making installers and such isn't. Because of that,
    most of the downloads you can get here are just builds of the executable thrown into a zip file.
    This means you may have to track down some dependencies if you want to play them, particularly for
    the XNA projects. I try to document what is necessary, but in case you are having trouble, you can
    shoot me an e-mail.
</p>

<p>
    The astute observer will notice that not all of the games listed here have downloads.  That is
    because I don't have the rights to redistribute all of them and in some cases, it just wasn't worth
    either of our time for me to do so. I put the projects up anyway because it's still fun to see what
    I was working on all those years ago.

    Any comments or feedback is welcome. Please enjoy.
