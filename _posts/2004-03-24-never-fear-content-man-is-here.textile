So once again it must be I to the rescue!! _HA_ Just kidding, I know I'm not one to put much content on this page, but it seems as though everyone else, although loaded with pictures is a lazy bum.
 So it boils down to the fact that I have two new pictures to present to you folks and I've put them online. So without further adou I present "the three lovely ladies we frequently have dinner with":#postid1, and "all of us at their place":#postid1.

Also for your convenience you will find links to movie clips found in each of our folders, on the gallery page. Enjoy!
