Although I have not added much content to the site lately, I think when I do contribute it's a lot more than posting some "random link":http://meph.eu.org/. Look at the last four news posts... Go ahead. Scroll down and see for yourself. There is no content, just babble. Willow always whines about how he is the only one who ever does anything around here, but all he does is make sure there is a new useless post on Monday and Thursdays. Ah I can't say all that. He does good and I know he's busy. But hear me fellow monkeys: if all you have to say is that you're the only one to update, keep it to yourself. No one wants to read that. I mean who would say such a thing... oh wait. um...


 Here's your "rant":http://www.duelingmonkeys.com/otc.php?view=specific&item=47. Goodbye.
