So I got an email requesting that for the lazies out there we have an [online feedback form](feedback.php) so you don't have to load up a program just to tell us we suck. Also this way its anonymous.

Anyway, that's done. Please tell us something, so far this place is where Willow and I seem to just tell each other whats going on in our lives, even though he's 20 feet from me right now.

 I got 2 of the 4 foods we cooked up last night up, but I don't think I'll add sweet potatoes or baked beans. They're pretty simple and self explanatory, but that doesn't take away from the level of satisfaction my taste bud's enjoyed. I did post [Shishkabobs](/recipes/shishkabobs.html) and [Roasted Corn on the Cob](/recipes/roasted-corn.html) though, both were superlicious. There's even a picture of the kabobs.

Oh yeah, one last thing: I added a new field to the food descriptions called Svg (for servings) so you can see how many people you're feeding. We'll have to go through and change each one, so be patient and ignore the ones that say it serves zero people
