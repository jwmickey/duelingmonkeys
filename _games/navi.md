summary: "My failed attempt at making a 3d game similar to Star Control 2 Super Melee mode."
---
Navi was the code name for an unnamed project that was to be a space-themed arena shooter akin to Star Control 2 Super Melee. The original idea is that players would have a choice of 5 ships, then also choose between 5 pilots. The ship would determine the primary weapon and the base statistics, while the pilot would provide a secondary weapon and stat modifiers.

I never ended up finishing it. In fact, I didn't even get that far. I only ended up implementing 2 ships never did anything with pilots, and only had one simple stage. However, I did spend quite a bit of time (and had a lot of fun) making the 3d models, textures, animations, and effects for the whole thing. I think some of the art stuff ended up being kind of cool and I even recycled a lot of it into our samples for [Gamebryo](http://www.emergent.net).

Well before I'd ever heard of a Game Jam, a few of us at the office were discussing the possibility of trying to make a game over the course of one weekend. The idea behind Navi that Shaun and I came up with was larger than one weekend but we figured we could get a head start and put a framework into place, then have everyone else join in when it was ready. Well, it was never ready. The framework just went on and on forever. Shaun stopped working on it pretty early and for some reason I clung to the idea that I could finish on my own and kept working on it in tiny bits and pieces.

Eventually I realized that progress was too slow, I had way to far to go before anything interesting would get done, and that it wasn't fun to work on anymore so I quit. On the bright side, I do still have these screenshots.
