So yeah Willow is making me update tonight... and I can guaruntee 1000% that there won't be an update waiting on monday as MLK weekend is coming up and The Monkies are heading to the Mountains!!
 But in that sense, you can be satisfied knowing we'll have some funny sh.tuff for the next update.

Also coming soon is a new about page and hopefully a return to some cool iconage (depending on Willow and Wayne's aptitude to finish work... _muhahahha putting it in an update to force completeion--I went there_).

So in the mean time I leave you with some fond memories with an old link to [A Modest Destiny](http://www.squidi.net) and _from the Animaniacs_.... with [&quot;The Monkey Song&quot;](http://www.duelingmonkeys.com/classic/filespace/wastrel/Animaniacs_The_Monkey_Song.mp3).
peace
