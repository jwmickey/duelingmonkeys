Well, after much trial and tribulation, I have finally gotten my black, wirey, tentacle-like, fingers on a copy of 3D Studio Max. When it rains, it pours. The version I got happened to be 5, and coincidentally, I got it from 3 independant sources all in the same day. My friends finally got it, and gave me a burned disc, I finally finished downloading it on kazaa (took like a week), and I found where Jody had put it in his shared files.

 Anyway, I was going to work on the comic for final fantasy VIII, or work on my little movie-project, but I had to see if I still had it as far as max was concerned. When I started out, I was kind of intimidated because I couldn't think of an easy way to get done what I was thinking of doing. But after I started popping primitives on there, it all came back to me. Yes, the magic has returned, and now I can create anything imaginable (assuming unimaginable timespan). I made a couple quick models for my kick-booty mimesis class, and imported them into the UT 2003 engine.

 I made a couple screenshots of what they look like in-game on a computer with VERY Crappy video settings. Additionally, I didn't bother making a texture for the lamp, so it looks like a big block of raw aluminum right now. Anyway, [check](https://content.duelingmonkeys.com/filespace/willow/shot0.jpg) [these](https://content.duelingmonkeys.com/filespace/willow/shot1.jpg) [out](https://content.duelingmonkeys.com/filespace/willow/shot2.jpg) if you are bored. If you take a look at the weapon, you can see how bad the video settings are, so don't take it out on me.

 So now you know my excuse for taking longer getting the next comic up, but at least I gave you something to look at. I'll try to do some work tommorow... really, I will!

 &#42;edit&#42; I made this post at 4 in the morning last night, so it counts as today, so I'm changing it's date to yesterday so todays post can be at the top. Now piss off.
