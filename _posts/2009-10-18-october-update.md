Hey everyone, It seems like its about time to catch up on things; I'll start with an update on Karma Riot.

I'm still working on Karma Riot with a decent amount of regularity. A few other people have expressed interest in helping out with it, so I'm spending a little time trying to organize tasks and describe them such that the other people understand what needs to get done. Hopefully help will be a time saver in the long run, but even if it isn't I still think it's worth it because I'm helping other people learn how much fun it is to make games.

I've mostly been messing with graphics code recently. I sunk a lot of time into setting up a shader to draw the background all of the way up to the horizon; it wasn't a hard problem, but I didn't realize there were free shader debugging tools out there. Too bad I found out about them after I figured out what I was doing wrong. Anyways, here is a new screenshot:

On a completely unrelated note, I spent last weekend visiting my family back in the mountains. I took some time while I was there to start socializing my 10 month old nephew in the ways of video games.

That's all for now. Don't forget to start putting together your Halloween costumes!
