I think that I should make a regular section of articles whenever this happens, for some reason when I'm looking for things to do to keep from having to do my homework and I've exhausted every flash site on the entire internet, I just feel like writing an update, I don't know why.

 Anyway, I was thinking this section could have links and critiques of all the flash sites/webcomics I came across during my all-night journey in circles around the net. Oh yeah, by the way, it's 6:58 am and I haven't started my homework yet. I guess I should start soon, I'm sitting here listening to the cool tunes of Guitar Vader, and I'm feeling the effects of the ritalin kick in.

 Oh well, during the daytime hours when you are all bored at work or wherever and I'm asleep in class, you can no doubt entertain yourselfs with [this flash website](http://www.newgrounds.com/collection/wearerobots) as well as my next item. But before presenting you with the golden link, i must say that this is the one of the coolest games I've ever played, it's another skifree at last, but with the powerpuff girls - the best cartoon characters EVER! Anyway, check [the fast and the flurrious](http://www.cartoonnetwork.com/play/action/ppg_fastandflurrious/index.html) out. It's great.

 Some of the best flash stuff I've seen has come from television station's webpages, which is interesting, apparently people do a better job when they are getting paid. Anywho, good morning, don't let the, uh, ... chair-bugs bite.
