Hey guys, it's Jody checking in. I wanted to write a quick update to show you all a little project I've been working on called [Iconorator](http://iconorator.com).

It's pretty simple idea: I want to use a sprite for icons in webpages. The icon packs I use contain hudreds or thousands of icons, so it doesn't make sense to make a sprite with all of them when I am probably using a couple dozen at most. I wanted a tool to be able to simply check off the icons I need and generate a sprite image and the CSS needed to display them, and thus, Iconorator was born.

I know there are plenty of sprite builders out there, but this one is somewhat unique in that it is exactly what I'm looking for :-)

Check it out and let me know what you think.
