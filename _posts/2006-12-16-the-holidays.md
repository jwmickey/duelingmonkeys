The Holidays are here again, and boy they sure did sneak up on me this year. I can't say that I'm terribly excited about them this go round, and I won't go into why, but aside from helping my grandma put up her pre-lit Christmas tree - the lights were my favorite part :( - the Christmas Dueling Monkey's menu is all the decorating I've done. Today (the 16th) was the first time I've been out to do any shopping, and it was, as expected, crappy.

 On the bright side, we do get a couple of days off from work, which is always nice. Except that I have a lot to get done before the end of the year (I'm waiting on stuff to download, otherwise I wouldn't be doing this update) and that is why I'm working at 1:30 AM on a Sunday morning.

 This has been a very short udpate, and most of it was me whining about the holidays not being so fun this time, so for that I apologize, but now sleep deprivation is setting in and I must call it a night.
