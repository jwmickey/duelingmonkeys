Last night, I found my self staring at my alarm clock thinking: &quot;I'm going to get six hours of sleep tonight! Awesome!&quot; Then I climbed up into my bed and saw that it was neatly made. This caused me to think a bit because I do not normally (read: ever) make my bed.

 We had a Halloween get together last friday. Friday night (/saturday morning) I went to bed after trying to wash all of my [makeup](https://content.duelingmonkeys.com/gallery/halloween%202003/haloweengang.jpg) off, but I didn't manage to get it all off, so I made a big, red, mess all over my sheets. I washed my sheets the next day and made my bed with them when they were done.

 The implication here is that I did not get to sleep in my own bed from then until last night. Why, you might ask? Because I didn't get to sleep. Over the past seven days, I've only gotten 3 nights of sleep. It has been one hellish nightmare, but I think it's almost over.

 I'm happy now that I can sleep at night (despite the fact that I still hate sleeping), and I'm sure you'll be seeing the result of that relief and happiness in the form of art or modeling or a video or something up on the webpage soon. As it stands, I haven't done anything in the immediate past, so for this reason, I will give you a (cop out) link.

 Here it is, folks, [your moment of zen](http://www.pen-paper.net/modules.php?set_albumName=JamesRyman&op=modload&name=gallery&file=index&include=view_album.php).
