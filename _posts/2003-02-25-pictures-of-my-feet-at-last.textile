Howdy folks. As it turns out, all that homework I stayed up all last night trying to procrastinate from wasn't due at all. It didn't even exist. Oops.

 Anyway, I have been playing with pictures, and because it is so easy to add stuff to the galleries, I have been adding like the count (&#42;thunder crashes&#42;)

 "Cool Stuff":coolstuff.php is where you will find links to all the galleries. The 'pictures' gallery were mostly taken with my crappy camera, so they suck. Sorry. Anyway, enjoy. I suppose it would be a good idea to get some sleep eventually as I haven't had any in a long time and it's already 4:24 am.
