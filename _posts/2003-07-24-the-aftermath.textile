Thanks for all who came out with me to celebrate my birthday. And thanks also to those who wanted to come, but couldn't for one reason or another.

 With all the celebrating going on, we haven't had too much time to give you a fun way to end the week. Sorry, but you'll have to head over to "Homestar's":http://www.homestarrunner.com or something in the meantime.

 Willow forgot to end my little cookie contest the other day so I'll finish it up here. Wesley is the undisputed champion and has 10 days to claim his prize. ah hahahaha. You should have read the fine print sucker!

 For those of you not aware, Wesley is in Japan until mid-August.

 Anyway, here is the original &quot;artwork&quot; provided by one of our readers. I give you, "Warren's Story":/classic/images/gallery/user%20contributed/warren_all.jpg.

 One more thing, I added "Moore's Chicken":cooking.php?view=specific&item=31 to the cookbook. It's quick and easy.

 Have a good weekend folks!
