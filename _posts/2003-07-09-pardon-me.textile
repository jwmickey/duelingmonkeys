Hey guys! I know we've been sticking to this whole Monday/Wednesday/Friday format, but I have something to say that I felt like posting RIGHT NOW, so just bear with me a minute, it'll be short.

 I HATE sleep! I hate it. I don't ever want to go to sleep again. It's 5 am, my whole body is tired, it's begging me to go to sleep. Everybody else has gone to sleep, there is nobody to play with. But I HATE SLEEPING! I don't want to do it EVER again.
