I've been trying to think of a good title/theme for the Mario Kart clone recently and the one that I like so far is KARMA RIOT. Mainly because it's an anagram for Mario Kart. It also gives me some options for the theme. I've worked on it about 18 hours total over the past few weeks, and I think I'm making pretty good progress on the functionality. It helps a lot that my friend Pawel is pitching in as well.

I haven't really started on any of the art, so visually it's going to look completely different once I get to it, however many parts of the game are already in place:

* Analog steering, gas, breaking
* Data driven track physics parameters - different surfaces (as authored by MS paint) can have different traction and drag
* Loosing traction allows you to powerslide
* Lap counter and recognizing game over
* Multiplayer and split screen support
* Traction meter

Here are some screenshots for you to enjoy:

_We tested the simulation with a top-down renderer_

_Then just recently added the perspective rendering with proxy art and AI_

_I like the idea of super-deformed ATVs rather than go-karts. This is my mockup_

Well, that's it for now. The other bit of news is that (the aforementioned) Pawel got married. Congratulations to Pawel. I wish I could post a picture of the wedding party (I was in it), but I don't have one handy and Pawel is currently living it up in Hawaii.
