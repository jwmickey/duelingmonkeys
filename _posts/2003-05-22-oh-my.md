Look at all these updates to the webpage! It's pure madness! I can't take much more of it!

 In the past few days I've been working on a message board where you, our beloved readers, can easliy give feedback, comment on our stupid posts, or whine about whatever. Its not too fancy, but I wanted to keep it simple. Please use it, I could have taken a nap instead of working on it.

 There are a couple of new recipies up, although right after I posted &quot;Frozen Veggies&quot; I realized that Willow had already taken care of it ages ago. But mine has a list of all the stuff Green Giant makes, so HA! Take THAT you evil monkey!

 Alright boys and girls, its time for you to go play now. So head on over to [Your Two Cents](topics.php) and spill your guts
