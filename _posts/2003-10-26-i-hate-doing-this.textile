and by this, I do of course mean posting for no reason other than moving the last horrible useless news post down the list. I'm really sorry. I have plenty of excuses though.

 Let me count them:
 1) I went home this weekend for my grandmother's birthday
 2) Afterwards, I went to a halloween thing with some of my family whom I don't see but a few times a year.
 3) Today I had to drive back to Raleigh, go to a movie (Scary Movie 3), come home and watch 2 movies at the same time (Dogma and Alien Ressurection were on TV), and then play some video games of course.

 So you see, I really had a busy weekend. And tommorow I have to go to work an hour and a half early because we are getting ready for Christmas season already. I also can't do much with this site or the movies site until I get [this new one](http://www.gamedevelopersclub.org/new/activities.php) looking good and more importantly _working_ correctly for the Game Developers Club. I hope we don't get sued by you-know-who because of the suggestiveness of the links and such at the top. I know if it were my company then I'd be happy that someone still loved me even though that since those games were released my market share had dropped like a MA241 student's GPA.

 Anyway, Willow has scanned another drawing and requested some input on a color scheme. So take a look at the [black and white picture](#) and [post any suggestions here](#). Your comments are either much appreciated or suck. You can probably tell which based on Willow's suttle, yet hinting replies at how he now hates you.
 BYE!
