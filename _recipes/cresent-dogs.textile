h3. Ingredients

* 8-pack Hot Dogs
* Cheese
* 6-pack Canned Cresent Rolls

h3. Directions

Separate the Cresent Rolls and roll a Hot Dog with some cheese of your choice. You'll have two dogs left over, but I'm sure you can figure out a way to make them yummy. Place into oven on an ungreased cookie sheet until rolls are golden brown.
h3. Comments

This one's pretty quick and easy. Only bad part about cleaning is the pan can be a bit of a pain to clean up if the cheese leaks out on it and burns, which happens almost every time (hey, we like cheese!).

 We served these along with "Oreda's Waffle Fries":cooking.php?view=specific&item=7 this week
