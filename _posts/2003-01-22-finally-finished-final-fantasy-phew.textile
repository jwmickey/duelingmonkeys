Well, at least for the first week or so of my new slacker schedule, I have put my time to good use. I wrote an all new Reflection on Modern Classics, and additionally created a comic to accompany it. You may be pleased to view it "here":otc.php?view=specific&item=19

 On another note, as soon as my brother accepts an alias, I'm going to make him an e-mail address from this address, and he has expressed interest in contributing to the page some. What this means for me is that I get to create a new comic character for him, yay!

 In other news, Wayne finally got around to writing his own article: a game review of the very classic Rareware title "Donkey Kong Country":otc.php?view=specific&item=20. Good job. And on one final note, I am a slacker.
