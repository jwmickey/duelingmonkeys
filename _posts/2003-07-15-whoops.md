I almost forgot to update. Usually it's done between midnight and 5 am. I got up this morning and realized I'd forgotten.

 Anyway, I posted some pictures of my [new cousin, Cooper](https://content.duelingmonkeys.com/gallery/wayne/2month_smile.jpg), and some of [my family](https://content.duelingmonkeys.com/gallery/wayne/mifamilia.jpg), which can be found in [my gallery](galleries.php?section=wayne). The dogs are named Hannah (the bigger, whiter collie), Zack (the smaller, darker collie), and Riley (the short golden dog with no feet).

 I don't have time right now to record the movie from the video camera, but later today I'll post Willow's disection of a watermelon.

 Until then, be sure to check out this little game I've got going on in the message boards. Read [this thread](topics.php?topicID=1057124976) and join in. Make plenty of guesses and you can catch up with Wesley and Wastrel. If they are still way off by the time I post the movie I'll drop more hints.

 Have a great day!
