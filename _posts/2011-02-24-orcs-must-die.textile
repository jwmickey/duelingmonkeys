Greetings all. I'm going to make this a relatively short update because I've got to get packed for a trip to San Francisco! I'm going to spend a few days enjoying the city with Amanda, then attend the "Game Developers Conference":http://www.gdconf.com.

So I'm working on a game project these days with Paul, but it's coming along very slow, so I don't have anything to show yet there. However, one of the reasons it's been going slow is because I have another hobby project that I'm working on.

I've been thinking for a while about ways to procedurally generate content for games, and I became curious to try and make a generic tool that helped you author a recipe for certain types of procedural content. This was also a good chance to learn about "WPF":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Presentation_Foundation and a few of the unique features of the C# language that I've been ignoring all of this time. The tool is still pretty early so it can't do a whole lot yet; I'm still trying to figure out if this idea can even work. However, it can at least produce some screenshots to liven up an update!

There is also very exciting stuff going on at work! I'm really excited to say that today "we":http://www.robotentertainment.com announced "Orcs Must Die!":http://www.robotentertainment.com/games/orcsmustdie. OMD is an original IP with some unique mechanics. I've actually moved off of "Age of Empires Online":http://www.ageofempiresonline.com to work on OMD now.
