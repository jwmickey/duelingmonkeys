Yo yo yo. It's such a beautiful day outside, it's quite a shame I have to work all day. Sorry, I don't mean to waste your time telling you things you already know. I especially don't mean to because Wayne will beat me for making useless posts.

 So, I have to give this post meaning. As you may have noticed, I have considerable interest in game development stuff. I am very excited about this project:

 &quot;... funded by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The idea is for us to build a UT2K3 mod that teaches kids about the effects of sun exposure. My idea currently is to create a game where you're a life guard on a beach, and your tasks are to run around giving people sun screen, sun block, umbrellas, hats, etc, to slow their exposure to the sun. While you're doing all this, people along the beach will be getting up and swimming, moving their blankets into the sun, playing beach games like catch or some other easily animated action games. In this regard, it's a little like a resource management game, where your resources are the sunscreen bottles, umbrellas and hats, and the levels that you're managing are the sun exposure levels of the people on the beach. &quot;

 This may not sound like something a lot of you want to play, but it sounds like a lot of fun to make. Getting to model a scenic beach vista. Create my own perfect vacation spot. Getting to do 3d models and textures for beach chicks, and animate them. You get the idea.

 If any of this comes into fruition, You will be seeing some screenshots in the [modeling gallery](galleries.php?section=modeling) sometime.

 Also, (although I've almost given up on the thought of getting feedback) I've been messing around with my graphics engine again recently, but I'm encountering problems. If anybody feels like giving me some C++ pointers, (bad pun, sorry) let me know.
