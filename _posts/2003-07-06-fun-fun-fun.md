Willow and I almost had more fun than we could handle this weekend. After arriving at Lake Chatuge (at 4:15 am) we of course went to sleep, but the next morning the fun began. Tubing and wakeboarding from behind a [new boat](https://content.duelingmonkeys.com/gallery/willow/boat5.jpg), jumping the enormous wake from the aforementioned boat with jet skis, and darting on and off road with [dual sports](https://content.duelingmonkeys.com/gallery/willow/mike_ds.jpg).

 I'll have to say that all that fun can do a number on your back. And your shoulders. And your legs. Come to think of it my entire body hurts. Especially after riding in a car for the past 7 hours. The trip home took longer than usual due to July 4th traffic and some people who had to stop and look at wrecks on the other side of the interstate. We were backed up for an hour at less than 10 miles per hour, sometimes stopped, because of this.

 Even we get bored on trips that long, so we played the state game: see how many different license plates you can spot from start to finish. We saw [28 states](https://content.duelingmonkeys.com/gallery/miscellaneous/july2k3_road_trip.jpg) including our own driving from Lake Chatuge (on the border of NC and GA) to Raleigh.

 Anyway, this is all we have for today. There are more pictures from the weekend but it might take a while to get them. We hope everyone enjoyed their holiday. By the way, don't forget what those fireworks represent.
