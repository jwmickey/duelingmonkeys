I think a lot has happened since my last update. However, I can't really remember what's happened because it's been so long. Oops. I won't wait as long next time.

I wish I could show you some pictures of our halloween costumes. However, I didn't take any and Jody hasn't uploaded them, fortunately I found this picture of me in my costume on the internet:

_Yep, that's definetely me_


_Edit: OK, Jody did end up posting some pictures in the "Halloween gallery":/gallery/halloween. Here's a picture: "of us":/images/gallery/halloween/DSCF1640.JPG. You may recognize Ryu and Chun-Li in the image as well._

Last week I made a surprise visit to one of our customers/evaluators at work. Mainly, the surprise was on my part; I got asked if I could go to Seattle after lunch and was on an airplane 4 hours later. Anyway, that was a lot of fun. I hung out with "Loose Cannon":http://www.loosecannonstudios.com/. All in all a good trip.

Work has been pretty hectic lately. It's one of those things I wish I could talk about, but that wouldn't be appropriate. Hopefully I'll start work on a cool new mini-project soon.

I've also spent a decent amount of time in and out of the clinic lately trying to figure out what the problem with my pancreas is. Here is the forumula for every visit:

# Wait
# Perform uncomfortable test
# Wait
# Results inconclusive
# Schedule another (more uncomfortable) test

Here is a summary of what all the doctors have told me in plain english: &quot;Your pancreas is messed up. However, it's not too messed up. We have no idea why.&quot;

To round things out, here is a rapid fire list of things I find interesting right now:

* "Watchmen":http://www.amazon.com/Watchmen-Alan-Moore/dp/0930289234/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1259116226&sr=8-5
* "Doom RL":http://doom.chaosforge.org/
* "Dragon Age":http://dragonage.bioware.com/
* "30 Rock":http://www.nbc.com/30-rock/
* "World of Goo":http://www.worldofgoo.com/ (finally got around to it)
* "Pancreatitis":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_pancreatitis

Karma Riot is making great progress too, but I'll save that update for once we've passed our next milestone.

Have a nice Thanksgiving
