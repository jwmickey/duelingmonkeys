The computer I have been using for the past year-and-a-half was a spare of Wayne's. The reason this was necessary is that my computer is five years old. The poor old lass just doesn't have it in her anymore.

 Now Wayne's old computer must prepare itself for abandonment, because, at long last, I have aquired a new computer.

 I'm so happy with it, I almost can't contain myself! Let's see what we have here, in ascending order of interest:

* Black 350W case (w/ front usb 2.0)
* Black Samsung DVD-ROM (supposed to be very quiet)
* Asus nForce2 motherboard (integrated 6 channel sound), with 400 mhz fsb
* 512 mb Corsair RAM (400 mhz)
* Seagate 120G HD w/ 8 mb cache (7200 RPM)
* AMD Athlon XP 2600+
* *ATI Radeon 9600 Pro* 128 mb

The graphics card is my favorite part. nVidia and ATI are so busy trying to prove that their directX 9 support is the best that they are putting out all sorts of tech demos showing off all sorts of things my kick&#64;$$ card can do. Not to mention benchmarking programs that I've been hunting down like a hawk.

 I did make up some screen shots with UT2k3 running with every setting maxed out, but I wasn't able to connect to our ftp server to upload the pics. Oh well, the screenshots don't do it justice anyway.

 I'm going to download more stuff now!
