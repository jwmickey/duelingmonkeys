that I'm not able to remind myself of my incorrigible stupidity. For example, Monday night I stayed up too late (specifically all night and the next day) procrastinating from my homework, as I am prone to do. Just last night, I had the brilliance to top that by doing it again. Of course tonight, I didn't even have pressing homework, I stayed up all night simply because I'm irresponsible.

 I just realized that I have to eat breakfast fast if I want to catch the crappy "CAT bus":/otc.html?view=specific&item=14, so I'm going to have to bring this little update to a close quickly.

 Basically, what's going on in my life is now I live with 3 other people instead of one. When you would think this would make it easier to update the page regularly becuase you have more people who want to do it, this is not the case. Actually, we are all more prone to expect someone else to do it now that there are four of us, and updating becomes more difficult. Since I'm limited on time, I can't bring any reasonable meaning to this post.

 At least you know I'm alive.
