Ok so I just wasted a good twenty minutes on trying to change my icon. But I'm tired and it didn't work. So whilst being called a slacker I have really been toiling diligently on our next grandious secret project. And by diligently I mean not-so-much. But the rough draft is done, now comes the hard part to take care of details. Seeing as how Wastrel Monkey will spend the entire month of March traveling for Graduate School interviews and visiting sunny San Diego (where he got accepted!), I don't forsee much updating on my behalf.

 So in a long-winded fashion I just wanted to say the title slacker suits me fine! In the mean time here's some more "pictures":http://www.duelingmonkeys.com/galleries.php?section=Apartment&type=image to tide you over. (I promised a friend to take pictures of my apartment, and in slack fashion three months later have gotten them posted). There would have been ski pictures too, but our last ski trip was a big ice/sleet/hail/snowstorm adventure. Meaning no kodak moments.
 But Wesley and I shall try again at Snowshoe this 'weekend' (really midweek) and I'll get to break in my new skis!
 In the meantime enjoy your useless random "link":http://animal-pictures.duble.com/pictures-photos-pics/monkey/funny-monkey/funny-monkey6.htm_(I also like picture 7 I think its cute, mainly b/c I like that type of dog)._
