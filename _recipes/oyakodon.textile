h3. Comments

this is one of my favorite dishes (thanks Hitomi!). its a bit difficult to get at first, you will probably have to make it a few times before you get it right. i guessed at the measurements, because i don't measure when i make it. you might have to play around with it and adjust the levels of water, soy sauce, or sake. i've made this many times and it takes me only about 15 min (the rice takes about 30). the end.
