since i have recently noticed the lack of updates on the website, i decided it was time i stepped in to save the day ... again. of course, i am not one to point fingers since i have not updated in many many weeks ... ok months. besides all that - i figure it is time for a hawaii update since i will be leaving the islands in approximately one month.

 since my last update, i have been back east for a wedding, made it south for a family and friends visit, had the pleasure of seeing some of the monkeys on my maui stomping grounds, and entertained family as well as family friends from japan. but the most exciting adventure in the recent past has been my hiking ad camping inside haleakela. for the uneducated about hawaii, haleakela (translated into &quot;house of the sun&quot;) is the dormant volcano on the east side of maui. i went hiking into the crater and spent the night in one of the cabins before hiking back out the next morning. i am very sore after the outing but walked away with some good pictures and a few nice blisters on my toes (i believe one is the size of yemen).

 the whales are slowly becoming more sparse (i havent seen one in days) but the waters are warming slightly. spring is upon us with summer right around the corner. the weather, however, leaves something to be desired. i feel like its been raining forever. i have heard the phrase, &quot;a shitty day in paradise is better than a shitty day at work.&quot; but what if you work in paradise? how about that? and when you work on a boat in paradise it is even worse. i say a shitty day in paradise is worse than a shitty day in work because you expect paradise to be perfect whereas you expect work to suck. so there. put THAT on your ugly beach bags.

 meanwhile, i will be sending out more pictures to willow, however he alread has many of the hawaii pictures and none of them are on the website, so i should probably not even mention photos.
