I'm sorry, but the time has come again.

 It's not like I don't have anything to post. We've got an endless supply of Mayan ruin pictures, and a boat-load of others that need posting and linking, but I just don't have time for it.

 Between projects and job applications and day dreaming and museums, I feel thin. Like butter over too much bread.

 It's 4 AM. I have to get up at 8. [Here's your stupid link](http://www.jmoneystudios.net/mortalpoet/shavecut.html), leave me alone so I can sleep.
