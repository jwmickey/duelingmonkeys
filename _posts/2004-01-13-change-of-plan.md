Hey, sorry about the late update. I was talking with Wastrel and we realized that updating 3 times a week is tough. For that reason, we are going to change the update schedule little.

 So, we will now update on Monday and Thursday. Since this is effective immediately, I don't even have to finish this post. Expect an update from Wastrel tommorrow or there will be hell to pay.
