 Once upon a time,
 I met a man named debu
 he liked to eat cheese.

 I went to journey
 across the great Pacific.
 there, I ate some cats.

 I glare at the bricks
 of the big, fat, ugly, mean school.
 My face falls down hard.

 Ouch.

 Today, the fourth day
 I cannot think very clearly
 then my update [sucks](https://content.duelingmonkeys.com/gallery/humor/shcool.jpg).
