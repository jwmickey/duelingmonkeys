Howdy folks. It's early Friday morning and I'm about to go to bed, but first I'm going to make this little update and read some novel.

 So I "wrote a rant":/otc.html?view=specific&item=43 earlier tonight, but it's not really so much of a rant per se. You'll have to read it and figure out what it is.

 I also "posted a new topic":topics.php?topicID=1065162893 in the message board about the upcoming movies section of this site. Please read it and give me input, so I can possibly do some work this weekend on it.

 That's all for now. My bed is calling. Happy Friday everyone!
