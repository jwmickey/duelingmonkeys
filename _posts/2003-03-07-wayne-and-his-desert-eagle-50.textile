A short while back, I did a comic-book style action picture of [myself](images/gallery/art/actionwillow.jpg) which was very cool. Just to round out the gallery, I did a little art tonight and made one for [Wayne](images/gallery/art/actionwayne.jpg). Unlike mine, I can assure you that this does not look very much like Wayne in real life. Except for perhaps the anger and the handgun. Hope you enjoy.

 I kind of got bored part of the way through this one and tried to go all fast, and it has taken it's toll. But after I finished all the highlights, it's just hard to think about where you can go back to to change and improve without starting parts over. Even being brisk, it still took about 4 hours from pose idea to posting.

 As an extra bonus, I decided to put the two pictures together. This only took about 10 minutes. Awe at the [Dueling Monkeys](images/gallery/art/fighters.jpg)!

 Anyway, I'd like to take a moment to congratulate myself on the site's 50th update! Saying as we've only been around for a couple months, I'd say that's a pretty good rate. In honor, I was going to make a new icon for the top left pose/cool-thing picture. But I really don't feel like doing that now. 50 posts may seem like it doesn't have any meaning, but I assure you that it has more meaning than celebrating 100,000 hits. Plus, I need more things to celebrate.
