Howdy folks. Have you ever noticed on peoples websites, where they say they are going to update regularly, then the don't and they miss like a whole week, then they say &quot;it's because I've been really busy at work&quot; or some sort of crap like that? I hate that.

 Anyhow, I haven't updated this site in quite a while mainly because I've been really busy at work.

 ...

 Who am I kidding? I don't do work. The real reason is that I just haven't had anything interesting to post. I haven't worked on the bank or any digital art in the past few days. I have, however done some other interesting things. First off, I don't know if I told you about my little non-animated animated movie, but I finished a couple frames of that.

 Additionally, I have actually been playing some games. I haven't done it in a pretty long time, so this is notable. I recently beat Splinter Cell, a very challenging and often frustrating game. Additionally, I beat Panzer Dragoon for the fourth time. Hmm... I should write reviews of these. I think I'll do that now.

 On one last note, for some reason, last night I had a surge of interest in composing music. I think I just might try and make some time to do that soon. That will be good motivation to get the 'cool stuff' section up and running.
