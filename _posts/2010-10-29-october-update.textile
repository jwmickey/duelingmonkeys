So my life is pretty busy these days, you might have picked up on that in the last post. I've settled into my apartment in Dallas and so far everything is pretty nice here. Work is going good so far, but I'll save the details for later. I've done some exciting stuff recently and I need to tell you about it before it's too late!

h3. Caving

One of Amanda's many hobbies is "Caving":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caving, which is basically climbing down to mysterious underground caverns, exploring around a little bit, getting lost a few times, and generally getting completely covered in mud. I went with her on her most recent trip to "Friars Hole Cave":http://www.wvencyclopedia.org/articles/2071 preserve where hundreds of other cavers met up to go exploring together.

I'm not going to go into too much detail because trying to describe caving is like trying to describe a monument - you can't really communicate the feeling you get when you see it, which is kind of the point anyway. Unfortunately, I also didn't really take pictures so this is the only photographic evidence I have of my adventure:

h3. Hawaii

In the time between my former job and my current job, I wanted to get a chance to spend some time with my family (and Amanda as well, of course). This ended up taking on the form of a trip to Hawaii. Much to my surprise Amanda, both my parents, all of my brothers, and my aunt/uncle/cousins were all able to make it out. I had a super-great time and fortunately this time I was surrounded by people who take pictures of things. I've put some up in the "gallery":/gallery/mike-vacations.

_Editor's note: I didn't actually upload any pictures to the gallery yet because I didn't have time yet. Maybe they'll be there later, maybe not. Sorry_

Well, that's it for now, next month I'm planning on talking about the exciting stuff going on with video game development so stay tuned. Oh yeah, happy halloween and stuff too. I still don't know what I'm going to do for a costume; I hope it works out!
