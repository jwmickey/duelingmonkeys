I'd just to take a moment to complain about how hard it is to write an article on Final Fantasy that is legible and, more difficult, free of many vulgar obseneties. It's kind of like saying something ridiculously funny while keeping a strait face - it's tough. I hope you appreciate how much mental effort I go through to bring you articles that give the impression that i'm jovially looking back at my past mistakes and laughing at them, as opposed to revealing my true burning black heart concerning the subject. Whining like that is what "the rest":http://www.somethingawful.com of the internet is for. Although most of you probably already know how full of hatred I already am anyway.

 Anyway, in an amazing feat of self-control I have created another intellectually crisp and refreshing "reflection on modern classics":otc.php?view=reflection concerning nothing other than the infamous "Final Fantasy VIII":otc.php?view=specific&item=21 ... again. I may actually return a third time because I have not even gotten the horse to proverbial 'critical condition' by my repeated beatings. Anyway, enjoy my pointless ramblings about something history will eventually forget anyway.

 By the way, I should have it's comic done soon as well.
