### Comments

Cantaloupe and Honeydew are pretty self explanitory, but I figured I'd just remind you how much of a great side it makes.

 A bowl full of these delicious fruits can last for several meals, refrigerated in-between, go well with several entres, and taste GREAT.

 The only down side to these things is that they are kind of pricey for a snack. Honeydew are usually four bucks, and cantaloupe two. In perspective, this is only about the price of 2 bags of chips, but they last longer, taste just as good, and are a hell of a lot more healthy. Too bad they take so long to carve.
