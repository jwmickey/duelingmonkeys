i have an annoucement that is about 54 days overdue. _I GRADUATED._ yes, thats right folks, i have joined the ranks of the unemployed. lets just say i'm on &quot;_vacation_.&quot; and what a nice vacation it has been. went to SF right after graduation, then to the padres house for christmas, then D.C. for a few days, NYC for new years (times square was a bit of a dissapointment), and then off to HI for el los padres anniversary. not bad, not bad at all.

 but now i'm back! from outer space! and you see me here with that look upon my face! (&#42;smack!) i mean, back from vacation. so i'm here in raleigh with no money and no job and no car and no money. but one thing i do have is "PICTURES":http://www.duelingmonkeys.com/galleries.php?section=hawaii%202005&type=image from HI. lets see, there are some cool ones of myself, and of Willow... and some of our dorky brothers, i think one or two with Wheedle, and a really sweet one of mis padres in the sunset on their 25th ANNIVERSARY!!! congradulations to them!

 so i totally had tons of stuff to put in this update, but i've decided it might be best not to overwhelm you guys. i don't want to overburden your fragile little minds. actually, the real reason is so that i can make another update tomorrow or wed and impress Wayne and Willow. Muahahahahahaha! i'm awesome. THE END
