So it's been about a month since I've updated my own webpage. Maybe more. Sorry, I just haven't been in the mood to do any significant changes or even post any decent content. I may have lost my web page creative desire (or something like that). This semester is definitely keeping me busy, but I can't blame it all on that.

 Anyway, I did add a "new side dish":http://www.duelingmonkeys.com/cooking.php?view=specific&item=37 to our cooking catalog. It's pretty good stuff when you don't accidently add a whole block of velveeta instead of only a cup. Yeah. I did that.

 I tried looking for some random link in my favorites list but I'm just not as resourceful as our friend Willow. Sorry guys.
 We did try out some Burritos the other week but the recipie won't go up until we figure out how we like them best.

 Thats all, go watch "Strongbad":http://www.homestarrunner.com/ now. It's Monday.
