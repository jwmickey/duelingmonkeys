Let me tell you about two monkeys (perhaps three) who have become some serious slackers. One of them even adopted the word itself in part of his screen name! Notice the last two updates were by me. Granted Willow and Wesley were away on a fabulous vacation.

 But, they've both been back for over two weeks now. Closer to three. Wesley is REALLY slack because he is usually still in bed when I get home from my _first_ job.

 You may be wondering why I haven't updated as well. Stop wondering right now. I worked at least 50 hours this week and I am a full time student. I'll cut those hours back to not-so-sucky by this time next week, but until then I am excused from updating except for when three weeks go by and the slackers still haven't done it.

 P.S. Both of those slackers are still in the bed.
