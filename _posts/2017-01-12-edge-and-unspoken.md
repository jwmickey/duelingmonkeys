There were a whopping 3 games that came out in 2016 that I worked on. I've talked about [Ratchet and Clank](/2016/06/28/ratchet-and-clank.html) already, the others are both games that were published by [Oculus](https://www.oculus.com/) for their Rift VR headset.

## Edge of Nowhere

The first is [Edge of Nowhere](http://www.insomniacgames.com/games/edge-of-nowhere/) a horror-ish adventure game inspired by Lofecraft's Mountains of Madness. It came out last June, not too long after the launch of the Rift itself.

I joined this project about halfway through its development schedule. There were a lot of problems to solve at that time and it was pretty tough to sort out what needed to be done the most. In the end I feel like there are a lot of things we could have done better, but still, we broke a lot of new ground and some parts of it are really cool. Even more than before, my role on this game was focused on managing production; trying to make sure that all of the designers had clear direction, properly scoped and scheduled work, defining the development process, good communication between departments, etc.

I was able to get my hands dirty a little bit. I worked on the design and implementation of the enemy vision visualization and the hero's observation mode visualization. I wish I had some cool videos or screenshots, but it's kind of hard to take screenshots of VR stuff and have it make much sense compared to seeing it in-game.

Anyway, if you have a rift, definitely check it out. Also, if you are ever going to play it, don't watch the spoiler-heavy launch trailer!

## The Unspoken

As Edge was wrapping up, I transitioned to another Oculus project; [The Unspoken](http://www.insomniacgames.com/games/the-unspoken/). This accompanied the launch of the Oculus Touch controllers, released on December 6th 2016.

Again, I came on about halfway through development. Again, I was mostly a manager and didn't have time to own specific features. I did make a big push for organizing our telemetry efforts so that we have a much better sense of how people are playing the game and what sorts of issues are common and that effort has really paid off. For a fighting game, I feel like we made a well balanced game for competetive play which isn't easy!

The Touch controllers are pretty awesome. If you are curious at all, you can set up a demo at [select Best Buy locations](https://live.oculus.com/bestbuy/search). The Unspoken is part of the demo (or so I'm told).

Maybe next time I can talk about some new hobby projects :)
