Let me start by saying Hello again. It, of course, has been a while since I've posted anything here or on the message boards. Now that the holiday season has passed us once again, I will hopefully have a little more free time. I'm not saying that I'll spend said free time updating this website, but at least there will be more free time :).

 The reason I'm posting today is because although at work we *don't* have the day off, I have been fighting a crappy cold since Friday, so I took the day off to rest. I'm now extremely bored, yet don't feel like doing anything. I don't even want to sleep. I do have this crazy pain reliever from when I had my wisdom teeth taken out that I'm sure would make the sleeping process much easier. However, I think I'll hold off for something like unbearable back pain.

 I visited "ArsTechnica":http://www.arstechnica.com for the first time in a long time today. The first article on the page was about Coldplay's new album and it's "advanced copy protection software":http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20060102-5877.html. I'll admit that I own a Coldplay CD, but I'll simply do without for this one.

 Ok I'm bored again, good luck on your next search for something to do. Ohhh! Check "this site":http://www.yukihime.com/comics/paremix/ out, it will make you laugh! Thank Willow for that one.
