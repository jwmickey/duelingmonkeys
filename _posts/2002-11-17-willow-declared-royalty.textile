Xbox live was released friday, and natrually, I was there. I played Mechassault this last weekend more than I should have, definately enough to know that I can kick most people out there's butts. Gabe from "Penny Arcade":http://www.penny-arcade.com seems to believe that he is the mech king. Well, until I have a chance to test that out, I am declaring myself mech king. Want some, Gabe? Come and get it.

 One of you fools want some? Bring it. My tag is DuelingMonkeys. Wayne will also be playing every once in a while, so don't jump to the conclusion you are better than me, if you just down one of my mechs. If you see DuelingMonkeys and his guest, you'd better believe it's the both of us ready to rock the house.
