This is the DuelingMonkeys site in [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) format.  

### What? ###

* Fairly static, so no need for a database, login, etc.
* You can write posts, recipes, games, etc. in Markdown(https://bitbucket.org/tutorials/markdowndemo) or Textile(http://redcloth.org/textile)

### How do I get set up? ###

* Everything you need to know is here: http://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/
* I have not tried installing in Windows, but there are community instructions
* It may be easier to use a VM like VirtualBox with Vagrant if you want to test/preview posts, but all you really need to do is commit a new document.
