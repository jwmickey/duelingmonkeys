### Ingredients

* 4 Baking Potatoes
* 6 oz. (1 1/2 cup) pack shredded Cheddar Cheese
* Sour Cream
* 1/2 stick butter
* 1/2 small package REAL bacon pieces

### Directions

* You can either microwave or bake your potatoes in the oven:
* ** Oven: Bake for 90 minutes at 400 degrees
** Microwave: Cook on high for 4-6 minutes per potato(varies by microwave, make sure center is soft)
* Cut potatoes in half lengthwise
* Scoop potatoes from skin, making sure to leave the skin in tact so you can refill them later (be sure to leave enough so the skin does not collapse
* Mix half the package of cheese, 4 spoonfuls sour cream, and butter with potatoes
* Refill potato skins, topping with remaining cheese and bacon pieces
* Return potatoes to oven (leave in halfs) until cheese is melted

### Comments

The portions aren't an exact science, you can adjust them as you want. If you don't like sour cream, don't worry, there's only a hint of flavor and it really does make them better (I'm not a sour cream fan). Baked Potatoes are healthy but not with cheese, butter, and bacon. But who wants potatoes without the good stuff? These make great a great side dish to steak or chicken, or by themselves as appetizers / party snacks.
