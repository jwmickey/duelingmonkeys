I finally made good on one of my &quot;promises&quot; and created a user database so you guys can log in and yes, edit posts! Since the message board is the dominant feature of the site, I figured it needed the most attention. While I still think it's a piece of crap and needs to be redone (if two people post at the exact same second, it will break), this should please you all for a while. First let me make this clear: You do not and will never have to register to post. If you do register, you do not have to be logged in to post. If you register as Sam and want to change your author name to Cynthia for whatever reason, you can. The main reason to register is so you can edit posts. If you post without being logged in, you cannot edit that post. Ever.

 The other reason to register is because you can upload your very own icon to use instead of our incredibly boring set that has not changed or expanded in 3 years. You can upload any gif, jpeg, or png of any size, but it will be resized to 75px square. Therefore, it would be best that your picture is at least close to square and not too big that you won't be able to tell what it is when you shrink it down. Currently, you cannot change your icon after you register, but I will add an &quot;Account Manage&quot; page eventually. Until then, just email me if you want to change your icon. You will still be able to choose from the old icon set too.

 Last but not least, some quick guidelines for ediiting posts. You can't edit a post that you didn't author (you must be logged in when you posted it originally). You can only edit a post within 24 hours of the original post date. When you do edit a post, your topic will not automatically float to the top. If you think I should change any of this, please give me your input. Thanks for visiting guys, now get out there and
