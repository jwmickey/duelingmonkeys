Found in the frozen foods section of your local Harris Teeter, these potato products come in great variety. You can easily identify them by the bright red bags with yellow lettering. They are very easy to make, and taste pretty good for the effort. Once you are done cooking them, just sprinkle them with salt, and you've got a great side.

 Our personal favorite types to get are tater tots, crispers, and waffle fries. You should definately give them all a shot.
