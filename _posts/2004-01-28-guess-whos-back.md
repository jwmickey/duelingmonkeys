... back again. No, its not 'Slim Shady', it's just me. Sorry to dissapoint you.

 I'm going to pull a Willow and make this update short and boring, filled mostly with me just talking. Here goes...

 So the snow kept me out of class for 2 and a half days and out of work (surprisingly) for a day. Work now sucks because we are behind. I would write a rant about how I spent 5 and a half hours there tonight and will likely do the same tommorow, but I would rather finish this update and go to bed.

 Willow just informed me that he added two images to the [Art Gallery](http://www.duelingmonkeys.com/galleries.php?section=art) and Wesley has a &quot;butt load&quot; (as said by Willow) to put up as soon as we remind him of how to do it. I also just bought a digital camera last weekend and have been snapping off random pictures (mostly bad ones that get deleted) so soon enough I'll have some to put up. Hopefully by then I'll have that [gallery thing](gallery/albums.php) figured out so it can replace the current setup. There isn't much documentation for putting it into your own site, unless you're using phpNuke.

 I was going to take a picture of my camera for you to see how cool it is but over the past 20 minutes I've found it rather difficult, perhaps impossible, to take a picture of this camera with this camera. I'll have to draw it I guess.

 Oh yeah, post in the message board some so it looks like our site is dynamic. Thanks!
