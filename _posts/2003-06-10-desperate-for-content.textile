I admit it. I'm desperate for content. I'm so boring, I know. I'm just not photoshop handy like our friend Willow. I wrote a rant tonight. It's not so much of a whinefest as just my two cents (no pun intended), which is just fine since the page it can be found on is under "our two cents":otc.php.

 Anyway, Willow promises some cool stuff for Friday. I'm also going to try to learn the tricks of the 3D trade. Wish me luck.

 By the way, I was going to post a movie of the two of us unleashing monkey hate on some apples, but the movies got deleted. Sorry. Hopefully they are backed up somewhere. I'll look harder later.
