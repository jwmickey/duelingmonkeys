Exciting news; as of last month I have a new niece! Kaylin Lang Daly. This summer Amanda and I are planning on taking a trip out to Shanghai to see her, which I'm excited about.

Also, I recently took a trip to San Francisco with Amanda. It was pretty awesome. We spent a few days walking around the city and saw lots of neat stuff. I've updated my "Vacation Gallery":/gallery/mike-vacations with a bunch of pictures. Cool stuff we did in San Francisco includes but is not limited to:

* Eating tasty Dim Sum
* Get a personal explanation of how Trolleys work from an operator
* Walk around Fisherman's Wharf, including seeing the legendary boat &quot;Bojangles&quot;, clam chowder, and some sea lions
* See an old penny arcade machine collection. The &quot;Opium Den&quot; was a highlight
* Dining in the French Quarter
* Drive over the Golden Gate Bridge
* Hike through "Muir Woods":http://www.parksconservancy.org/visit/park-sites/muir-woods-national-monument.html?gclid=COay-66s3KcCFUpJ2godGnl4-g
* The "California Academy of Sciences":http://www.calacademy.org/?gclid=CLn6j8us3KcCFcpQ2godCnxl_Q, which had a nice aquarium, indoor rainforest, and planetarium
* Drive through the Mission District and eat at the Taqueria
* Walk though "Golden Gate Park":http://www.golden-gate-park.com/, including a Japanese Tea Garden
* Visit Japan Town and eat mochi ice cream and an adorable crepe
* Visit a Tiki Bar
* Spend some quality time at the "King George Hotel":http://greystonehotels.com/kinggeorge/
* Eat some delicious deep dish pizza at "Little Star":http://www.littlestarpizza.com/
* Eat at the fancy "House of Prime Rib":http://houseofprimerib.net/home.html
* Ride around on the BART (Bay Area Rapid Transit)
* Some clothes shopping

Another reason that I was in San Francisco was to attend the 2011 "Game Developers Conference":http://www.gdconf.com. I think this might have been the first time (out of maybe 4?) that I went there entirely for education - I didn't have to help run a booth, give demos, or do sales support! I went to a lot of really good sessions and learned a lot of stuff. Some of the stuff I learned about there:

* Creating Game Trailers
* Sony's Next Generation Portable
* How not to fail
* Player Driven Story
* Encouraging Cooperation in Co-op Games
* Minimizing Exposition in Games
* Understing Cognitive Biases
* Networking in Halo Reach
* Automated LOD in Halo Reach
* Halo Reach Effects Tech
* Crytek and Epic tech demos
* Played the 3DS a little

I could tell you all about the stuff I learned in more detail but my notes were 15 pages so it's a bit much for a post here. If you are super curious you can just e-mail me. Anyway, that's it until next time!
