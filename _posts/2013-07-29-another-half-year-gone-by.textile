Hey folks, It's about time I write someting down about what's been going on in my life. Here goes!

* Got married to Amanda Daly!
* We went on an awesome honeymoon in St. Lucia
* We bought a new house together in Cary
* Did a lot of home improvements (some with my dad's help):
** Cleaned up the yard, bushes, trees and laid down mulch
** Stained the deck
** Touched up the paint on our screened in porch
** Had the hardwood floors sanded &amp; refinished
** Had carpet installed
** Had blinds installed
** Got a new bed
* The game I've been working on since "Ratchet &amp; Clank: FFA":http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZY1aeurQ2z4 was completed has now been announced: it's "Ratchet &amp; Clank: Into the Nexus":http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3X2M7USGkgM
* Probably plenty of other fine stuff, but since I only write once per six months, I can't remember any of it!

See you again next year!
