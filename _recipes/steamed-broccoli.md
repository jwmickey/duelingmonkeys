### Ingredients

* Fresh broccoli florets (crowns)

### Directions

1. Cut up broccoli into desired sizes.
1. Place broccoli into a pot that has a lid.
1. Add water until there is about ï¿½ an inch in the bottom of the pot.
1. Cook on medium heat, stirring occasionally, until at desired consistency. I go for a nice vibrant green color.
1. Drain and serve (or add to another dish).

### Comments

First off, the price is about $1.50 per pound, so you can get an idea from that.

 Basically you want to add water for two reasons (which can be applied to other vegetables). First, you donï¿½t want to burn the broccoli. Second, you want to steam it, which requires water. The idea is probably the same if you do it with frozen broccoli, since thereï¿½s ice in with that stuff that will melt. But, itï¿½s not as good as fresh veggies!
