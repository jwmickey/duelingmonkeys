You know, I once thought pokemon to be a video game. Thank god that I found "this article":http://www.crossroad.to/text/articles/pokemon5-99.html which revealed to me that pokemon is actually the work of the devil sent from the land of heathens to corrupt our children with sorcery and mind control.

 Whew! That was a close one! I'd better go burn my nintendo.

 But seriously folks, be wary of religion. Anywho. As (not) promised, I haven't done anything productive all weekend. That's why I'm posting links instead. However, to make up for my pathetic ineptitude as a website-guy-person is Dueling Monkey's Senior Foreign Correspondant Wastrel. Wastrel returns again to give you some appreciation for the cool that you got in his article "Air Conditioning":otc.php?view=specific&item=36.

 I'm hoping to redraw all of the duelingmonkeys sometime soon, so keep an eye out. However, I don't promise to do it. I don't know when I'll do it, if at all. Right now they are on paper but I can't scan them and illustrator them right now, especially saying as illustrator no longer works on my computer. That aside, I also have to be up at 6:30 tommorrow. Man, why do I do this?

 Right, I'm getting to bed.
