I missed an update! I know, I know, I'm starting to go the ways of Willow. Don't worry, there will be at least "one more":aboutus.php#wesley contributor to pick up our slack, maybe two if Wastrel wants in. The only problem is that these two make up like half our audience.

 Anyway, I wrote a review of "Tropico 2: Pirate Cove":otc.php?view=specific&item=41. I like it. Read it and see if you'd like it.

 We finished up Willow's new room. You know, the garage to bedroom conversion. Threre are some pictures in the "snapshots":galleries.php?section=snapshots gallery, or you can see them directly by clicking the list of links below.

* "Willow's art desk":#
* "Cieling fan and track lighting":#
* "Entering the room":#
* "A wall":#
* "No more garage door":#

Willow also finished a "poster":images/gallery/art/gdc_poster.jpg (190k) for the "Game Developer's Club":http://mimesis.csc.ncsu.edu/gdc/. It's original size was 2 feet by 3 feet! I managed to size it down to something you don't have to scroll for miles, but it's still rather large.

 Well thats all for this week. Sorry for shorting you a read on Wednesday. Have a good weekend and I'll try to remember to update for Monday since Willow is out until Monday afternoon.

 Later.
