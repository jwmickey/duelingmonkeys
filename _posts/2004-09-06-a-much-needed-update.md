_Editor here, I'm so so so so sorry that I've been so bad about updating this here page. I'm extremely busy, but I'll do my best to catch you all up when I can. In the meantime, our wonderful senior semi-foreign correspondent from Hawaii has decided to step in and help out - much to my relief._

 i was recently at the website and noticed that an update had not been made in quite some time, so i made it my duty to write one when i had a free moment. well ladies and gents: here is that moment. its 1:30am hawaii time and im just wide awake while my roommate is passed the funk out. i guess it was also about time that people knew that hawaii just isnt perfect. i must do what i can to make you all feel lucky to live on the mainland sometimes and not flaunt the beautiful waterfalls and coastline views.

 so here is the downfall to hawaii: the tourists must leave sometime. i wish i could say &quot;yay! no more silly white people that dont know their ahi from their ass&quot; but i cant say that. because my job was dependent on their existance. and now, Ocean Spirit - the boat that i called home away from home - had to be shut down because the tourist numbers were dwindling. i know must exert extra effort working on the boat with a 9 hour trip that goes over the waters known to many as &quot;the washing machine.&quot; well, it is time i let out my big secret. come one and come all! WHEEDLE GETS VERY SEASICK. there, i said it - and in CAPS no less. i work on a boat and i tend to be allergic to the motion of the ocean. going over the washing machine just doesnt make my inner ear very happy. BUT, i have been doing ok thus far - knock on a palm tree.

 the other downfall to hawaii: most people who work here, are purely summer help. my roommate and most of my new friends have left to go back to finish up school. how old and mature i feel to have already done that. not really - i just feel poor and slightly more bored. i do hope i have made some of you happier to be living in the NC area. paradise aint perfect. although we saw some spinner dolphins today and i got paid double time for the labor day holiday - life is just OK at the mo'.
