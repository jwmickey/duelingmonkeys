Wayne have had a dillemma on our hands the past few weeks. We got Xbox Live, but we didn't have an ethernet cable run out to the living room. This presented a difficulty because whatever genius designed this house not only decided not to include a crawl space, but they also put in a cathedral ceiling.

 Let's do a little predicate calculus:
 not(crawlspace) and (cathedral ceiling) implies not(ethernet cable)
 There you have it. No way to run our cable but through the house under the carpet, which is a huge hastle. Being the geniuses we are, we got a green cable (to go with our green xbox) not realizing the imposibility of hiding it subtley along the corners.

 My conclusion? Uh, I guess I don't really have one, I just wanted to complain.
