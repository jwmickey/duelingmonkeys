So Willow will not like the fact that while he plays the devil game, I am posting. _Muhahaha.... NO rambling from him this time, and no more complaining about his cool roommates normal desire to eat GOOD FOOD!!!_

Alors... for the content that I must post for me not to get b..complained to. Here is Willow's [Cooking Creations](/classic/images/gallery/wastrel/willows_creation.jpg), a picture of his [bday cake](/classic/images/gallery/wastrel/Im_not_13.jpg) from a while back, and last but not least... Willow attempting to be [cool](/classic/images/gallery/wastrel/hungarian_pride.jpg).

Well it's been a long tiring day/night for me so... peace out folks.
