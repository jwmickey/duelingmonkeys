check it top, wreck it - let's begin!

 Wow that's old school. Today the two most popular and beloved monkeys are going to bring you some REAL content! Can you believe it?

 First of all, we've been working on some burritos of our own design, although I doubt you can do too much to make a burrito &quot;original&quot; before it's not a burrito anymore, so take it as it comes. We think we've done a good job with these [beasts](/recipes/breathless-burritos.html), but if you care to improve on our methods, feel free to post your comments in the um, [comments section](http://www.duelingmonkeys.com/postcomment.php?newsID=193).

 Speaking of comments... I see that it's not so obvious of when there are new comments or any posted at all for that matter. I was thinking of having two forums in the [Your Two Cents](topics.php) section, one for the existing message board, and another for the comments. The links on the front page would be more or less for your convienence and will probably be the only way a new topic relating to the news can be started. Meaning you will only be able to add posts to existing comment topics. You'll figure it out.

 Willow speaks:

 I will elaborate on the details of the burritos recipe just a bit. We sliced three fresh jalepeno peppers and threw them in a skillet. After a few minutes of slaving over the range, I started coughing and hacking. Wayne just looked at me, apparently amused at my agitated state. I muttered something to the effect of 'can you not smell that?' before collapsing on the floor and dying from toxic fumes. He just laughed and went on cooking. A few minutes later he also realized all at once that he could not breathe either and suffered a similar fate. The rest of the night the two survivors ate the deadly meal out of respect. They too, unfortunately, did not survive.

 So, in other news, I've been working furiously at getting my motorcycle done. I've got the coding almost complete; now it leans as a motorcycle should. At least it leans as realistically as I'll ever want it to be. I made some nice looking team textures for it. The remaining work to be done is to pose a character so that they fit properly, as well as some other polish things like headlights and such. Finally, I need to program in the 'weapon'. I'm thinking that you hit fire to activate a bomb, then the next time it runs into something at a moderate speed, it blows up fantastically.

 Ok, I'll stop boring you all now. I'll post screenshots and maybe movies of the bike later.

 Oh yeah...

 Whoomp there it is.
