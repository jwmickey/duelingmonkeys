So, here's a funny story for you this morning. Ok, it's not a really a story, in fact it's not even funny. I'm just going to tell you something that happened; it explains the picture I'm going to link. If you want to get any entertainment out of these words I write here, you are on your own. Pretend it's funny, and maybe you can fool yourself.

 One day, I felt like singing. Fear not, however, I am far too wise to attempt this futile endeavour. (there have been secret experiments in the shower - all failed) I would not be so irresponsible to unleash my singing on the world. In fact, I should be paid not to. On the other hand, one so enlightened as me has other means of expressing my desires at my disposal. A sketch of cute little people singing a happy song was the result of this peculiar impulse.

 Fortunately, this was not the end. An artistic rampage followed the sketch. The aftermath of the rampage revealed a standalone page of comic. It is this comic that has brought us together today; me to present, and you to consume.

 Without further meaningless filler, I present "Imaginary Friend":images/gallery/art/imaginaryfriend.jpg, a comic by yours truly.

 I have spoken, now "piss off":http://www.jibjab.com.
