I was writing my last post at the desk at work. Then I had to move computers, so I just saved it expecting to edit it up in our office. When I get to the office, my partial post shows up on the webpage, but not in the database. This is a little strange to me. Now not only can I not finish it, I can't fix the blatant spelling error in the title. I guess my only option is to make another post explaining it (hence, now).

 Anyway, where was I? Oh yeah, black. Our movie is white asphalt is black. Ain't that a load of crap? In addition, we met some serious hurdles when it came to getting the appropriate post-production software to work. As I stated before, when I posted [this](https://content.duelingmonkeys.com/filespace/willow/introsmall.wmv), I hate windows movie maker because it forces you to use WMV format. Well, not only could we not get movie maker to save to a useful format, it couldn't even load the movie we had already video captured. This means we couldn't edit it unless we managed to get our hands on Premier. After struggling with Premier, we realize that it can't read wmv files, so the intro logo had to be redone. Thanks a lot Microsoft for windows movie faker.

 Assuming this post gets saved to the database, I'll hopefully come back later today and show you just what I'm talking about by posting some frame captures.
