For the first time since October of 2004, I have "written a rant":otc.php?view=specific&item=52! I can't believe that we haven't done a game review, rant, or reflection since then. There is plenty to write about, but we really do suck at writing these days. Therefore, I'm going to write a review on a game and come back to this news update in a few minutes...

 Alright, done. Now feast your eyes on a brand new game review of "Burnout 3":otc.php?view=specific&item=53! I hope I didn't compare it to Project Gotham Racing too much. That's a tough standard to hold. Well I feel that with two sources of time wasters I can end this update early and go to bed now. So everyone have a great weekend and hopefully we'll be able to start up some more frequent updates.
