Hey everyone. If there is anyone on earth out there that reads this website, I'd like to hear from you. I know you exist, the webalizer tells me you do.

 Here is the deal. I've come to realize that the section headings 'our two cents' and 'cool stuff' are fairly misrepresentative of what those sections actually contain. First off, 'our two cents' just isn't really an interesting title, and nobody goes to it. Who cares about our two cents anyway? Try to think of suggestions for a new name, maybe something like 'totally awesome stuff'. This leads me to the next point: 'cool stuff' is a crappy title because the whole page is cool stuff. It wouldn't be very navigatable if each section was named 'cool stuff' though, so we need to find a more descriptive heading, maybe 'pictures and other meaningless crap'. No, that's a bad idea. See? This is why I need your help.

 If you have any suggestions, seriously, any at all, e-mail them to [comments&#64;duelingmonkeys.com](mailto:comments@duelingmonkeys.com). Heck, you don't even have to have suggestions, I would be perfectly happy getting e-mails like 'hey, you are the coolest site on the intarnet!!!(' or 'WTF U guys need 2 RTFM!!! LOL!!! ROTFL!! U got 0WN3D!!)' or 'Michael, this is your mother, you need to come home this weekend and do your taxes.'
