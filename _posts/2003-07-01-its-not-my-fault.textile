So Willow and I had this crazy idea to do some stop-motion animation with this wooden doll he picked up somewhere. It was going to be great! We went through an hour of positioning, taking dozens of photos. Then, it happend. FILE NOT FOUND!!! WHAT! Why not!? The camera said ding ding dammit! Apparently you have to have the camera in the right mode. Thanks a lot Mr. Let-us-borrow-the-camera-guy. Why does your camera have to suck so much? It's ok. Don't beat yourself up, I'll do it later.

 A possible storyboard (though I must reassure you it is highly unlikely) was donated by the camera guy. I won't tell you the dialouge, but if you can guess the story the author promises you a box of cookies. Post your most educated guess(es) "here":topics.php?topicID=1057124976. Here is "Frame One":imageviewer.php?image=images/gallery/user%20contributed/Warren1.jpg, "Frame Two":imageviewer.php?image=images/gallery/user%20contributed/Warren2.jpg, and "Frame Three":imageviewer.php?image=images/gallery/user%20contributed/Warren3.jpg.

I will tell you that this weekend Willow and I are going on a road trip and the camera is going with us. It should promise a fun video, especially since we'll be super bored on a 12 hour drive. And once we get the stop-motion thing working it should be neat too.

 Oh yeah, write this down: 2 &#42; 150 watt lightbulbs + 300 watt power supply = HOT ROOM.
