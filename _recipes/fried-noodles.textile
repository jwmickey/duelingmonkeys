h3. Comments

I invented this meal when I could not find any complete meals left in the fridge and decided to get creative. Fortunately, it was a very successful experiment. The original idea was to get something close to lo mein using refrigerated leftover pasta noodles. When I first prepared the meal, I burned the bacon, so I don't know if adding bacon to the meal improves it or not. I do know that cooking things in bacon grease is a delicious and fantastic idea, so I left it in the instructions.
