Hey folks. This post serves to demonstrate two sad inevitabilities.

 Number one: I haven't done any new art content or writing since Monday, so I don't have anything original to post.

 Number two: I stayed up all night again putting off homework. If you've been reading this site for long, you should know that this is far from the first time this has happened as well.

 I guess there is nothing to do but post some random links, if [only](http://www.collegeboredom.com/) to [serve](http://www.verunne.net/illust.htm) by [delaying](http://members.tripod.com/~BayGourmet/wagyu.html) your [boredom](http://www.antra.dk/c_d_mmorpg.swf) a bit.
