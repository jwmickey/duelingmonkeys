hello everyone. wow, we haven't updated since oct 24th! i can see why you must be positively frothing at the mouths for something new and exciting to alleviate (if only briefly) the tedium of your pathetic, trite, insipid, stodgy, plebeian existences. what? too much? yea, sometimes i get a little carried away. sorry. sorry everyone. i'm sure your lives are abundant with excitement, but you may still get some minor enjoyment from the amazing extravaganza that was [HALLOWEEN 2004](http://www.duelingmonkeys.com/galleries.php?section=Halloween%202004&type=image). or maybe you won't. it actually wasn't that amazing, and i don't think it quite qualified as an extravaganza either. but that sounded good.

 now i know that you are all eagerly anticipating something grandois for the Dueling Monkeys 2 year anniversary, but i just wanna clue you guys in (so you don't think its some kind of sick joke) that we will not officially be recognizing the anniversary of the most awesomest website evar until about a week from now.

 now i know what you are thinking, &quot;but Wesley, wasn't this totally magnificent piece of webology created on Nov. 11th 2002?&quot; and my answer to that is, &quot;why yes, young one. this phenomenal stunning coolness was indeed created on Nov. 11th 2004.&quot; good job, you have just earned yourself a non-kick in the balls. we'll celebrate our own bloody anniversary whenever we bloody well feel like it! we don't need you ne'r-do-wells meddling in our affairs! honestly, you must find something better to do with your time. well go on, bugger off.
