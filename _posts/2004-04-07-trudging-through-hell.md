The story of my week is a tragic tale. It makes me sad to think about, so I'm not even going to try to summarize it here.

 so right now, I'm working on my 42nd hour of consciousness. This is largely due to my history group project, undergraduate research project, and senior project course. In addition to that, I have to organize a joint meeting for the International Game Developers Association and the Game Developers Club of NC State. Although I have finished my immediate work for the first three of those, the meeting is what I'm procrastinating on as I speak. I have several e-mails to write, and I just don't feel like doing it now.

 If there is anything that I've learned in my two computer graphics classes, it's that I hate computers. I don't want to ever program again.

 Anyway, I haven't done any official artwork per se, but I did go ahead and compile some of my sketches into a little [collage](/classic/images/gallery/art/sketchcollage.jpg). I have been experimenting with new shading methods, and I think they have served me particularly well with the guy's head and the girls body. Any comments are welcome, you can use the messageboard.

 Well, that'll be all for now. I'll catch up with you later.
