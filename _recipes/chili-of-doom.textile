### Ingredients

* 1 lb. ground beef ($2 - $3)
* 16 oz can of tomato sauce ($0.70)
* 16 oz can of red kidney beans ($0.70)
* Chili powder

### Directions

Put all ingredients in a crock pot. Do not cook the meat. Add as much chili powder as you want. More can be added later for flavering. Cook for about 18 hours, stiring occasionally. Ideally, you cook it until the meat has broken down into very fine bits.
### Comments

Can easily scale the quantity. Doubling this will feed about 7 people, if you're eating only chili. Don't worry about getting the ingredient quantities exactly correct. A few oz. off won't hurt anything. If you don't want a layer of fat on the top of the chili get lean ground beef.
